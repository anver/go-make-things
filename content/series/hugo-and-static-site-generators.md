I get asked enough about the tech behind my various websites and learning portals that I thought I'd compile the various articles I've written about them in one spot.

- **[Static websites](/static-websites/).** I talk about what static site generators are, and why I moved away from WordPress.
- **[Migrating from WordPress to Hugo](/migrating-from-wordpress-to-hugo/).** If you have an existing site you need to port over, here's how I did it.
- **[Automating the deployment of your site](/automating-the-deployment-of-your-static-site-with-hugo-and-github/).** How to automatically build and publish a new version of your static site every time you push an update to GitHub.
- **[How to schedule posts with a static website](/how-to-schedule-posts-with-a-static-website/).** How to schedules posts to go live at a future date and time.
- **[The Hugo Starter Kit](/the-hugo-starter-kit/).** A barebones starter project and theme for learning Hugo.
- **[Resources for building a JAMStack website or web app](/resources-for-building-a-jamstack-website-or-web-app/).** A collection of resources for building static websites.
