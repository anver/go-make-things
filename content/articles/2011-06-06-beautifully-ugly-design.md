title: Beautifully ugly design
---

<blockquote>People think it's this veneer - that the designers are handed this box and told, 'Make it look good!' That's not what we think design is. It's not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.

I've spent a lot of time over the last few weeks researching user experience, information architecture, and design.

I manage a website at work that creates career tutorials using social media like ebooks, discussion forums and podcasts, and the amount of information we now have has grown tremendously over the last two years. I've been concerned that as the amount of <em>stuff</em> we have grows, it becomes increasingly harder for people to find the things they're looking for.

Over the last few weeks, I've created countless mockups and designs. Nothing seemed to solve my design problem: How do you help busy people find information they need simply and quickly.

I also started using <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> this week, and it led to an epiphany.

<h2>The Beauty of Ugly Design</h2>

This is what the landing page for Instapaper looks like:

<img src="https://gomakethings.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Instapaper-510x350.png" alt="" title="Instapaper" width="510" height="350" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-731" />

It's utilitarian. It's spartan. It's bland. And because of that, it's amazingly beautiful.

The ugliness of Instapaper is what makes it so usable. There's no veneer, no overly-glossy sheen. And for everyday use, that's exactly what I need!

I'm still working through it, but my new layout may look something like one of these:

[caption id="attachment_732" align="aligncenter" width="560" caption="Mockup 1"]<img style="border: 1px solid black;" src="https://gomakethings.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/career-center-mockup-560x271.png" alt="" title="career-center-mockup" width="560" height="271" class="size-medium wp-image-732" />[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_750" align="aligncenter" width="560" caption="Mockup 2"]<img style="border: 1px solid black;" src="https://gomakethings.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/mock-up-2-560x244.png" alt="" title="mock-up-2" width="560" height="244" class="size-medium wp-image-750" />[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_751" align="aligncenter" width="560" caption="Mockup 3"]<img style="border: 1px solid black;" src="https://gomakethings.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/mock-up-3-560x332.png" alt="" title="mock-up-3" width="560" height="332" class="size-medium wp-image-751" />[/caption]

For comparison, here's the current layout:

<img src="https://gomakethings.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/career-center-2.png" alt="" title="career-center-2" width="560" height="821" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-740" />

What do you think? Before or after (or neither)?
