title: Make subscriptions opt-in
---

This weekend I renewed my subscription to <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/">FastCompany magazine</a>. It's literally the only magazine I still get in print. Yea, it's that good.

I've been a subscriber for the last year, and already have my account setup so that I don't receive emails about promotions, events or partner offers.

<strong>So I find it particularly annoying that FastCompany opts me back in to these things during the renewal process.</strong>

If they wanted to just ask me if I'd like to reconsider, I'd be cool with that. But default to opted-out, not opted-in. Sure, they may trick me into signing up because I don't notice. And maybe every now and then, someone will be pleasantly surprised.

But I'd just be pissed off that they took advantage of our relationship.
