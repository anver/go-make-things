Whenever someone signs up for my [daily developer tip](https://gomakethings.com), I ask them one question:

> Whatâ€™s the biggest challenge you face as a web developer?

I get back a lot of interesting answers.

The most common responses are things like [knowing what to focus on](/knowing-what-to-focus-on/), [finding good learning resources](/resources), [finding new roles](/career-guide), and just generally feeling like there's too much to know.

But for the first time ever, last week someone wrote back and asked me what *MY* biggest challenge is. Here's my response:

> Thanks for asking! No one has before, actually!
>
> I think the thing I struggle the most with right now is determining when something new is going to change the way our industry works for the better (like responsive web design did 5 or 6 years ago), and when it's just a fad that will fade away in a year or three (which is how I feel about our obsession with things like Angular and React).
>
> I try to avoid jumping from fad to fad, but I also don't want to be that old guy who misses out on something that's an important leap forward for us. I spend a lot of time thinking about the longer term impact of the things we make (and make with).
>
> Glad to have you on the list!

To add a bit of color to this example, when I first got into web development 6 or 7 years ago, [Ethan Marcotte](https://ethanmarcotte.com/) had just recently [coined the term responsive web design](https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design).

While a lot of older developers had moved on from table-based layouts, they were still firmly in the "websites for desktops" mindspace.

Many I talked to said things like, "I've heard of RWD, but I have no idea how it actually works." They were intrigued, but didn't see it as important enough to take the time to really dig into.

One of the first jobs I interviewed for while trying to leave my old career in Human Resources was for an internal UX job at the company I was working at. When I asked the interviewer if they were focused on adapting their work for mobile, she told me:

> Mobile is a fad, and one I that think is on its way out. Our customers don't want to do these things on their phones.

I declined that job on the spot, by the way.

I'll never forget that moment, though. Because it was obvious to me that there was an old guard of developers who *didn't get it* and couldn't see the big shift that was coming in our industry.

Now that I'm part of the older guard, and I've been doing this a while, I'm always afraid that will happen to me.

I fight for things like [progressive enhancement](/why-progressive-enhancement-still-matters/), [simplified development processes](/alternatives-to-css-in-js/), [using as little JavaScript as possible](/the-best-way-to-write-javascript-is-to-make-sure-your-site-works-without-it/). And in today's industry, that makes me a bit of a dinosaur.

I like to think I'm rebelling against the status quo and focusing on building more a resilient web, but I'm also advocating for older methods of doing things.

Am I the interviewer who didn't see the big shift mobile was about to cause? That's my biggest challenge!
