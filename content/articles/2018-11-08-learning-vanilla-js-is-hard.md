Modern vanilla JavaScript is amazingly powerful and simple.

The `querySelector()` and `querySelectorAll()` methods make getting elements in the DOM a snap. The `classList` API makes manipulating classes simple and intuitive. Modern array methods make manipulating data way easier than it used to be.

But *learning* vanilla JS? That can be *really* hard.

## Why learning can be so difficult

If you wanted to learn a framework like Vue, or a library like jQuery, where would you start?

Today's most popular libraries and frameworks have great documentation. They include "quick start" guides, sample projects, cookbooks, and lots of detail around the various methods and APIs.

Vanilla JS is different, though. There's no one-stop-shop for documentation.

## Learning options

The [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is an awesome resource, but it's also community-driven. That means some APIs and methods have great documentation, while others are... lacking.

Some things have tons of detail, while others have just a surface introduction. Some things are written clearly, while others are confusing. Some are oriented for beginners, while others use very technical language.

There's tons of courses out there.

Some of them are great. Others are so-so. Most of them brag about how many hours of content they include. Do you *actually* want an 80 hour course? Do you have time to watch all that? How do you go back and find something later?

And is video always the best medium for learning?

For some people it is. If you're like me, though, you may prefer text. Or maybe you like both. Video for introducing topics, and text for reference later.

And then there's StackOverflow.

Ever try asking a vanilla JS question there? The go to response is:

> Just use {jQuery|React|Vue}.

Sigh. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Good resources are hard to find

I struggled to learn vanilla JS.

I don't have a computer science degree, and came from a non-technical career before transitioning into front-end development. But most of the tutorials I found assumed I had a technical background that I didn't.

I learned by trying to make things, failing, Googling, trying again, failing some more, and eventually having some small breakthrough. My code was embarrassingly awful.

And then one day, things clicked.

Now, I'm laser-focused on making sure *you* don't have to struggle quite as much as I did.

I've found I have a knack for making complicated and confusing stuff more approachable. I write like I talk, and I talk in simple terms (with some profanity thrown in every now and then).

**If you're struggling to learn the fundamentals of JavaScript, I have resources to help you!**

## Two different ways to learn

I find people prefer to learn one of two ways:

1. By learning core concepts, and then applying them to reinforce what they just learned, or
2. By trying to figure out a task, and then backing into some techniques and approaches.

Some people prefer different approaches at different times. Whichever one you prefer, I have some resources to help you learn vanilla JS.
