I had the pleasure of [chatting with the JavaScript Jabber team](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/jsj-299-learn-javascript-youre-not-developer-chris-ferdinandi) about why I think modern web development is over-engineered, our over-reliance on JavaScript, and how to learn JS when you're not a developer.

We also talked about things like whether or not CSS is easier to learn than JS (it's not), finding mentors, writing code without libraries and frameworks, the myth of the full stack developer, and much much more.
