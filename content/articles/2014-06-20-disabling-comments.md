***Update on September 29, 2014:*** *Thanks to a new plugin, I've [brought comments back to this site](https://gomakethings.com/tarpit-say-goodbye-to-wordpress-comment-spam/).*

For some reason [Askimet](http://akismet.com/) has been letting through an increasing amount of comment spam over the last month. It's not uncommon for me to catch five or six spam comments a day live on the site.

Accordingly, I've decided to turn comments off on the site.

I'm not wild about doing this. I think the web is better with open conversation. But comment spam was becoming an annoying chore that was taking up time I could spend doing other things.

What I care about is conversations, and I want to make sure those are still able to happen, so in lieu of comments, I'm inviting people to connect with me on Twitter at [@ChrisFerdinandi](http://twitter.com/ChrisFerdinandi), or to [send me an email](https://gomakethings.com/about/). Hopefully that results in rich conversation around some awesome topics.
