title: How to connect a Roku to hotel wifi
---

Most hotel wifi networks require you to enter some information&mdash;a name or room number&mdash;to authorize a device. But because Roku's don't have web browsers, there's no way for you to do that on the device.

Most of the solutions to this online aren't very good:

* Bring a travel router.
* Run a virtual router on your computer.
* Spoof your Roku's MAC address on your computer to authenticate.

But there's a much, much simpler way: call hotel tech support. They can authenticate your device for you. Takes about 5 minutes.
