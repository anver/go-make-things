title: What do you want to learn next?
---

I could use your help.

Presales for my video course, [Vanilla JavaScript for Beginners](https://gomakethings.com/courses/vanilla-javascript-for-beginners/), have been terrible. That tells me I missed the mark somewhere.

So, I'd love to know: what do you want to learn next?

1. Are there any JavaScript topics you've been struggling with or wish someone could explain clearly and simply for you?
2. How do you learn best? Reading? Playing with code? Watching a video? Something else?
