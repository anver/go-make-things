The other day, I had a conversation with someone about the various ways to learn vanilla JS in 2019.

On the low cost end, you can buy courses on Udemy for $20. You can get a monthly subscription to Pluralsight or Egghead for about $35 a month. You can read free tutorials online.

On the premium end of the market, there are fantastic video courses from folks like Wes Bos and Ultimate Courses. They got *really* deep into their subject matter.

**With all this competition, why would someone choose my stuff?**

There are two reasons:

1. Content depth/structure
2. Learning support

## Content depth and structure

Some people find the idea of "18 hours of in-depth video lessons" on a topic really appealing.

Personally, I've purchased courses like that and *never* end up using them. I barely get through 45 minutes.

It's just *too much* for me and my learning style. It's daunting. It feels like a big thing I need to *get through*, and that's not what learning should feel like.

By comparison, my ebooks and video courses are designed to be short and narrowly focused on a single topic. You can complete the whole thing in about an hour, then get on with your life.

I also provide ebook versions of every course. A lot of people love video. Some people hate it. Some people want both.

I provide options.

## Learning support

You can find short video courses on Udemy, Egghead, and Pluralsight. You can find free tutorials online.

Some learning programs even offer Slack channels, like I do.

But I'm actually in my Slack channel. I answer questions, share tips and tricks, and help students get unstuck. My other students do, too.

The support around my learning offerings is one of the most valuable parts.

## I'm not for everyone

Some people would rather grind through some free tutorials. Some people would rather pay $20 for an Udemy course and try to fill in the gaps or things they're stuck on themselves.

Some people want a deep, into-the-weeds, 18-hour long courses.

And some people don't.

I'm 100% ok with the idea that my stuff isn't for everyone, and neither are the other people who work in this space.
