Over the weekend, [Kraken](https://cferdinandi.github.io/kraken/), my lightweight, open source boilerplate for front-end web developers, got updated to Normalize v4.x.

[Keel](https://keel.gomakethings.com/), my theme boilerplate for WordPress developers, is built on Kraken and was also updated. In addition, Keel picked up a more accessible dropdown navigation.

SVG support in the Media Uploader, formerly baked in Keel, has been removed and is not supported via [a free plugin](https://github.com/cferdinandi/wordpress-svg).
