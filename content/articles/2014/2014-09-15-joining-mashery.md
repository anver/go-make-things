title: Joining Mashery

Last week, I started a new role as a UI designer and front-end developer at [Mashery](http://www.mashery.com/). They help companies build and manage their [APIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface). I'm the guy who builds out the developer.your-company-name.com sites.

Briefly, here are three reasons why this job is so kick-ass:

1. APIs will be an integral part of the web as it increasingly becomes something we access in more than just a browser&mdash;in apps, on smart devices, and through non-visual interfaces (like Siri and Ok Google). I'm pumped to be part of that.
2. This is a hybrid role. In the past, I've been asked to choose whether I want to design things or build them. At Mashery, I don't have to. I get to translate business goals into device-agnostic web experiences, and then build them. I even get to help educate customers, clients and other developers on modern web best practices. Awesomesauce.
3. It's 100-percent remote. I get to role out of bed and start making awesome stuff, and structure my work around the way I work best. It's a recipe for awesome.

I'm thrilled to be part of Mashery, and grateful that I work in an such an exciting industry.
