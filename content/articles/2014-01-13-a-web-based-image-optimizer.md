In <a href="https://gomakethings.com/wicked-fast-websites/">Wicked Fast Websites</a>, I recommend that web developers optimize and smush images, a process that can decrease file size by 25-percent or more.

While OSX has the fantastic and free <a href="http://imageoptim.com/">ImageOptim app</a>, there hasn't been a great alternative for Windows users. But now there is.

<a href="http://b64.io/">b64.io</a> is a web-based, drag-and-drop image optimizer that compresses images with the same level of effectiveness as ImageOptim. It's free and platform agnostic (it even works on your iPhone!). <del>And unlike ImageOptim,</del> it provides a <a href="http://css-tricks.com/data-uris/">data URI</a> so you don't have to link to an external image at all (ImageOptim now has this functionality, too). Pretty cool!
