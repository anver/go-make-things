title: The move away from broadband (or why web performance still matters)
---

[According to Pew](http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/21/home-broadband-2015/), home broadband internet adoption in the US has plateaued, and in some demographics, decreased.

What we are seeing is a rise in people with smartphones but no home broadband. The mobile-only user is on the rise.

That means it's all the more likely that your website visitors will be coming to your site on devices with unpredictable connections and capabilities. Is your site up to the task?
