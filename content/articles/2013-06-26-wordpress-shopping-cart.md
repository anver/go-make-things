Need to setup a retail site? <a href="http://cferdinandi.github.io/wp-shopping-cart/">WordPress Shopping Cart</a> is a simple PayPal shopping cart for WordPress.
<!--more-->
WordPress Shopping Cart makes it easy for visitors to:
<ul>
<li>Add products to their shopping cart.</li>
<li>Update quantities and remove items.</li>
<li>Calculate shipping based on cart subtotal.</li>
<li>And checkout via PayPal.</li>
</ul>

WordPress Shopping Cart was designed to work with the <a href="http://cferdinandi.github.com/kraken/">Kraken boilerplate</a>, <a href="http://cferdinandi.github.io/kraken-for-wordpress/">Kraken for WordPress</a>, and <a href="http://cferdinandi.github.io/tables/">Tables</a>.

It should work great with other themes, too. You may just need to adjust the styling a little bit. <a href="http://cferdinandi.github.io/wp-shopping-cart/">Get it on GitHub.</a>
