When Japan was hit by a devastating earthquake last month, I started looking for photos to get a better understanding of what was really going on there. During the search, I discovered the fantastic <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/series/24hoursinpictures">24 hours in pictures</a> series from the UK-based The Guardian newspaper.

As a result, I've become a bit obsessed with photography and it's ability to tell stories. In addition to the Guardian, I've been tearing through <a href="http://chrisglass.com/album/">Chris Glass's photos</a>, and look forward to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/whatladder/">Justin Muir's daily photos</a> as part of his Project 365.

<strong>One thing I'm still trying to better understand is when to use photos versus when to use video to best tell a story.</strong>

Video projects like <a href="http://vimeo.com/1737450">Fifty People, One Question</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jU4oA3kkAWU">Koh Panyee Football Team</a> would not be nearly as impactful as a series of photographs... or would they?

My first inclination was first-person stories work better as video than text with photos. But then I think about WALL-E. One of my favorite things about that movie was how Pixar created such a compelling story without uttering a single word for the first 30-minutes or so.

What are your thoughts?
