A few months ago, I started working on a project to create a mobile learning app. I don't have any experience with backend development, so I decided to see if I could use WordPress to power the app (and save me from having to develop something).

After two weeks of experimenting, I had a simple but working web app.

There wasn't a one-stop shop for all of the stuff I wanted to build in. I had a lot of help from various websites, most notably <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stock Overflow</a>, along the way. To save you some time, I've put together a starter kit to help get your next project off the ground more quickly.
