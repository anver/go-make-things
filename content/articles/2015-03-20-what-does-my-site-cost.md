[Tim Kadlec](http://timkadlec.com/) has put together an awesome little site called [What does my site cost?](http://whatdoesmysitecost.com/)

It mashes up data about your site from [WebPageTest.org](http://www.webpagetest.org/) with average [data costs around the globe](http://www.itu.int/en/Pages/default.aspx) and financial metrics from the [World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org/) to provide you with a few different views of what your site costs to visitors around the world.

When lobbying for performance, this is nice, tangible metric to share with clients.
