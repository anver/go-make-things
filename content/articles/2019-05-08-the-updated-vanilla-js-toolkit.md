Over the last month or so I've made a few updates to the [Vanilla JS Toolkit](https://vanillajstoolkit.com/) to make it easier to use.

1. The [reference guide for vanilla JS methods and APIS](https://vanillajstoolkit.com/reference/) has been broken up into more logical sections, and paginated for easier reading, scanning, and linking.
2. Every [helper function](https://vanillajstoolkit.com/helpers/) now includes a link to a CodePen demo so that you can see it in action, plus an article on how it works if I've ever written one.
3. I've added more [boilerplates](https://vanillajstoolkit.com/boilerplates/) and simplified the presentation so you can more easily choose the right one for your project.
4. All methods, APIs, and helper functions now include browser support info, and links to polyfills if needed.
5. By popular demand, I've added [a search feature](https://vanillajstoolkit.com/search/) so you can more easily find what you're looking for.

If that sounds interesting, head over to [VanillaJSToolkit.com](https://vanillajstoolkit.com/) and check it out.
