[Kraken 4.2.0](http://cferdinandi.github.io/kraken/) came out today.

In addition to a few minor bug fixes and under-the-hood optimizations, it also brings with auto-compiling and [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) for Gulp users. Make your changes, hit save, and Kraken will compile your source files and documentation, and reload any pages you're working on.
