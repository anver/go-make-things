title: A Better Critique
---

<blockquote>In a well-run critique, we explicitly separate out the discussion of <strong>“What are we trying to do with this design?”</strong> from the discussion of <strong>“Does this rendition accomplish it?”</strong> By separating out these two pieces, we avoid digging into the designer’s work just because they unaware of a critical requirement or need.</blockquote>

It doesn't matter if you're a designer, an HR pro, whatever. Go read this post by Jared Spool on <a href="http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2011/10/27/moving-from-critical-review-to-critique/">a better design critique process</a> right now. It's awesome.
