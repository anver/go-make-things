Just how fast was Usain Bolt's record setting 100-meter sprint in this year's Olympics?

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/08/05/sports/olympics/the-100-meter-dash-one-race-every-medalist-ever.html">This infographic from the New York <em>Times</em></a> compares winners in the 100-meter dash from 2012 through 1896. It's amazing how much faster we've become over the last 100 years or so. The <em>Times</em> credits improvements in nutrition, footwear and track material.

I can't help but wonder if we're approaching the limit in human capability, or if numbers will continue to improve in the coming century.
