A friend of mine works for a non-profit, and the other day she asked me, "Should we be on LinkedIn?"

My answer: "It depends. Are the people you want to connect with there?"

She had been at a conference a few days earlier, and one of the speakers told the audience, "You <strong>need</strong> to be on LinkedIn." That's stupid. That's like saying every single brand needs to advertise at the Superbowl. If you're selling wine or pantyhose, that's probably not your target market.

Social media is just scalable conversation.

When should you use a social media channel? When the people you want to talk with do.
