Nick Risinger has put together an amazing online tool called the <a href="http://skysurvey.org/">Photopic Sky Survey</a>. It's a detailed, interactive sky map, and it's insanely awesome.

<blockquote>The Photopic Sky Survey is a 5,000 megapixel photograph of the entire night sky stitched together from 37,440 exposures. Large in size and scope, it portrays a world far beyond the one beneath our feet and reveals our familiar Milky Way with unfamiliar clarity.</blockquote>

It reminds me a bit of the <a href="http://vitotechnology.com/star-walk.html">Star Walk app</a>, which I would totally buy if I had an iPad.
