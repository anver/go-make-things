As a follow-up to [yesterday's article about organizations that use vanilla JS](/companies-that-use-vanilla-js/), I spun up a new site to keep track of this: [Vanilla JS List](https://vanillajslist.com/).

If you know of any companies that should get added, let me know! It's good to make this stuff more visible.
