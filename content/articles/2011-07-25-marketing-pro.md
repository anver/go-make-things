title: I&#8217;m officially a marketing pro
---

Three years ago, I started <a href="http://renegadehr.net/">Renegade HR</a>, a human resources blog, to share my personal take on the HR world. I learned how to code websites. I wrote a ton of ebooks. I started <a href="http://twitter.com/chrisferdinandi">using Twitter</a>.

Then I started doing some of that stuff at EMC, where I work.

Somewhere along the line, I realized that I didn't want to be an HR pro anymore. This other stuff was way more fun.

<h2>Starting today, I'm a marketing guy.</h2>

Officially, I'm a Senior Social Media Engagement Manager for our Training and Development organization.

What that means in practical terms is that I'll be helping implement new technologies like social media to further our learning initiatives. I'll also be marketing those initiatives internally and externally in new and fun ways.

Awesome!
