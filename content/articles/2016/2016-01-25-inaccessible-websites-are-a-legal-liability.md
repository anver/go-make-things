title: Inaccessible websites are a legal liability
---

Karl Groves maintains [an ongoing list of web accessibility-related lawsuits and settlements](http://www.karlgroves.com/2011/11/15/list-of-web-accessibility-related-litigation-and-settlements/). The number of lawsuits increased dramatically in 2015.

If your website isn't accessible to everyone, regardless of visual, cognitive, and neuromuscular impairments, you could be opening yourself up to legal risk.
