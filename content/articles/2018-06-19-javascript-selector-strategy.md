Back in April, [I wrote about JavaScript selectors](/javascript-selectors-in-html/), and specifically why I prefer to use data attributes as selectors over things like classes.

Reader [Emanuel Saramago sent me a tweet](https://twitter.com/EmanuelSaramago/status/983816342875856897) with some follow-up questions (shared with permission):

These are great observations/questions!

First, performance. Yes, class selectors are much faster than attribute selectors. [But that doesn't mean attribute selectors are slow.](/javascript-selector-performance/) We're still in the realm of thousands of operations a millisecond (one-thousandth of a second).

You'd need an insanely huge app with absurd numbers of DOM nodes before you start seeing meaningful performance issues with data attribute selectors.

Regarding multiple data attributes and which one to use as a selector, I recommend having an approach and sticking with it.

That might mean having an attribute that's sole job is as a selector (`[data-selector="my-plugin"]`), or it could mean hooking into an attribute that's already there conveying additional information (`[data-modal="#some-element"]`).

The important thing is being consistent in your approach, which keeps your code cleaner, easier to read, and more friendly to work on and debug.

Hope that helps!
