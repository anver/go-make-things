If you've ever wanted to publish your own ebook, but weren't sure how, [I've open sourced my ebook boilerplate](https://github.com/cferdinandi/ebook-boilerplate).

All of my [pocket guides](https://vanillajsguides.com) are written in markdown.

My ebook boilerplate is a command-line script that uses [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), [wkhtmltopdf](http://wkhtmltopdf.org/), and [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) to compile all of the files, syntax highlight code snippets, and automatically generate all of the file formats.

- PDF
- EPUB
- MOBI (for Kindles and such)
- HTML

It also optionally compiles all four files into a handy zip file for easy distribution.
