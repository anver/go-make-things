title: PAWS New England is looking for a front-end developer

Five years ago, I adopted a dog from [PAWS New England](http://pawsnewengland.com/). Four years ago, I gave their website [a responsive redesign](/projects/paws-new-england/).

Since then, traffic has **grown by 5x**, while mobile traffic has **increased by 27x** and now accounts for **more than 50-percent of all site traffic**. What started as a one-time project evolved into an ongoing partnership. The site has gone through various iterations&mdash;little nudges and tweaks to improve usability and make things run faster.

I'm immensely proud of what we've built, but I also don't have the time to focus on this project like I used to, so I'm looking for another front-end developer to help me out.

## The Details

PAWS is 100% volunteer run. Not a single one of us, including the founders, receive a penny for the work we do. This allows us to spend 99-cents of every single dollar that comes in on saving dogs lives. It also means this is an unpaid, volunteer position.

It will involve less than 5 hours of work a week. You'll be "reporting" to me, so-to-speak, and I'll be available to help you get up-to-speed. Things you'll be doing:

* Making content updates, usually about once a month, when special events and opportunities arise.
* Implementing new features (like an events calendar) into the existing site design.
* Identifying UX pain points and implementing small, interative changes to improve usability.
* Working with WordPress, Sass, and native JavaScript (I'll coach and train you as needed).
