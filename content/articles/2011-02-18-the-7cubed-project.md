Want to make more awesome stuff? Lock yourself in a room for a few days with a few close friends and focus on nothing but creating things.

For the <a href="http://7cubedproject.com/">7Cubed Project</a>, seven undergrads at the University of Waterloo locked themselves in a room for seven days with the intent of creating one app a day.

They came up with some cool stuff (and at least <a href="http://7cubedproject.com/post/1665781822/day-4-the-bitter-taste-of-failure">one failure</a>), but the one everyone's buzzing about is <a href="http://quickcite.it/">QuickCite</a>, a bibliography app. All you have to do is scan the barcode of a book and QuickCite emails you a formatted bibliography entry. Wish this was around when I was in grad school!
