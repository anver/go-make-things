title: MailChimp and WordPress
---

I've open sourced a couple of new WordPress plugins.

[GMT MailChimp](https://github.com/cferdinandi/gmt-mailchimp) let's you create barebones MailChimp signup forms.

It asks for just a single piece of information---an email address---to maximize conversion rates. And unlike most MailChimp plugins, it allows you to optionally add people not just to a specific list, but also to a group within that list for segmented marketing.

[GMT MailChimp for EDD](https://github.com/cferdinandi/gmt-mailchimp-for-edd) extends GMT MailChimp to [Easy Digital Downloads](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/).

When someone purchases a specific product or uses a specific discount code, you can add them to a MailChimp list, and optionally, to a group as well.
