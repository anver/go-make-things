John Lilly, former CEO of Mozilla, <a href="http://john.jubjubs.net/2011/10/09/steve-jobs/">on Steve Jobs...</a>

<blockquote>I hope the message that people really take, really internalize is that being yourself, as hard as you can, is the way to have important and lasting impact on our world. That might be in the context of technology. It might be in the context of technology, or the arts, or sports, or government, or social justice — or even in the context of your family and close friends.

It almost doesn’t matter. The thing that matters most is to figure out what’s important to you, what’s core to you, and do that. Be that. And do it as well as you possibly can, every single day.</blockquote>
