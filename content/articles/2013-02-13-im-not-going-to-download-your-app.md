Tom Morris on <a href="http://tommorris.org/posts/8070">apps vs the web...</a>

<blockquote>In the “web vs. apps” war, I think you can infer which side I’m on. I wouldn’t download a BBC app or an NPR app for my computer. Why would I want one on my phone? Do I buy a separate radio to listen to different stations? No. The functionality is the same, the only thing that differs is the content. Apps ought to provide some actual functionality, not just blobs of content wrapped up in binary files.</blockquote>

Couldn't agree more. Apps are great, but don't make me download to access your content.
