First, go read this post on Wired about <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2014/01/internet-org-hackathon-low-end-rules/">the web in the developing world</a>:

<blockquote>
  The most common smartphone in the world is, according to Ericsson, the K-Touch W 619. It has a single core processor, and a 3.5-inch display with 480 x 320 resolution.

What’s more, they’re going to run that phone on networks where traffic moves at kilobytes per second, not megabytes.

Then go read this post on <a href="http://blog.hood.ie/2013/11/say-hello-to-offline-first/">Offline First, the next step in progressive enhancement</a>:

<blockquote>
  We can’t keep building apps with the desktop mindset of permanent, fast connectivity, where a temporary disconnection or slow service is regarded as a problem and communicated as an error.
