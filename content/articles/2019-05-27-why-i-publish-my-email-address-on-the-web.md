Early last year, I removed comments from my site.

In their place, I posted a message inviting people to email me directly (or contact me on Twitter) if they had any questions or comments.

I also publish my email address [on my about page](/about), and send my daily newsletter from my actual email address, too. None of that `donotreply` business here. And no random contact form that goes into the void.

It's been awesome.

## Why I do it

So, comments on websites kind of suck.

They're overrun with spam. Many of them are just people trying to show off how much they think they know about a topic of "prove you wrong" or point out that you spelled a word wrong because OMG spelling police!

This is *my* personal website that *I* maintain to share *my* thoughts and ideas and perspectives. It's not a public message board.

That doesn't mean I don't want feedback or comments. I love hearing those. I love getting reader questions. Seriously, please email me to ask me anything JS (or hip-hop) related!

But not at the bottom of my articles.

Getting an email from a reader means I get to interact with them in a more meaningful way. There's none of that "did they actually see that I posted a response a few days later" uncertainty. It's more personal.

And I often share reader emails and perspectives (with permission) when I think it's something everyone else reading my stuff will enjoy or benefit from, too.

## But what about spam?

I mentioned that spam comments were a big issue. So what about email spam?

Not a problem for me.

I suspect my email provider's amazing spam filters catch a lot of it. I use G-Suite from Google.

But another thing that I think helps a lot is that I encode my email address. WordPress has a great article on [how to protect your email from harvesters](https://codex.wordpress.org/Protection_From_Harvesters).

I don't use WordPress anymore, but in the article, they link to [this online encoding tool](http://www.wbwip.com/wbw/emailencoder.html). I put my email into it, and use the encoded version that comes out all over my website instead.

## One last thing

If you ever have a JS question, like something I wrote, disagree with something I wrote, or just want to say, please email me.

You can reach me at {{<email>}}.
