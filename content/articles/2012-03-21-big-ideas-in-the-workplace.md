Last week, <a href="http://www.knowhr.com/blog/2012/03/16/do-we-have-big-ideas-anymore/">Frank Roche over at Know HR</a> noted...

<blockquote>[President Theodore Roosevelt and John Muir] took a stagecoach by themselves into the wilderness. Camped under the stars. Talked about preservation.

And thought big thoughts.

And I wondered what big management thoughts we’ve had in the last 100 years.</blockquote>

It's a good question, and Frank and I had an interesting discussion in the comments section. I sometimes wonder if we don’t hear about any big ideas in work because it’s all being over-engineered.

What if we just got back to the basics?

<ol>
<li>Hire smart, intellectually curious people.</li>
<li>Give them enough freedom to do great work, but enough coaching, feedback and support to keep them engaged.</li>
<li>Have completely irrelevant fun activities often to stave off burnout, build bonds, and keep the creative juices flowing.</li>
</ol>

I’m sure I’m missing something, but those big items get you pretty far.
