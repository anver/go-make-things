title: My goal for the new year
---

This year, I have one simple goal: to become reconnected to the real world through a more deliberate use of technology.

Technology is great, but the more I use it, the more I find I'm less observant of the beautiful world around me. In 2012, I'll be working to reverse that trend. I'm not in any way shunning technology. I just want to use it in a more thoughtful way.

Here are a few tasks to help me get there...

<ol>
<li>Listen more than I talk.</li>
<li>Do more real life networking.</li>
<li>Read more diversely, but subscribe to fewer blogs overall.</li>
<li>Use my iPhone (and computer) less.</li>
<li>Make more stuff.</li>
<li>Spend more time outside.</li>
<li>Take more intentional photographs. Meaning, actually focus on composition and purpose.</li>
</ol>
