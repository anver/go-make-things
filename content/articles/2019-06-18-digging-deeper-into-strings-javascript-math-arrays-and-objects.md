My *Strings, Arrays, and Objects* [pocket guide](https://vanillajsguides.com) had gotten really large and was still missing important information.

Last week, I split it into two new guides: [Strings & Numbers](https://vanillajsguides.com/strings-and-numbers/) and [Arrays & Objects](https://vanillajsguides.com/arrays-and-objects/).

*Strings & Numbers* includes more details on the template literal syntax, basic arithmatic, and more complex math with JavaScript. *Arrays & Objects* goes into more detail on modern Array methods like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`.

And there's a new project: a JS tip calculator app.

You can watch [sample lessons for Strings & Numbers](https://vanillajsguides.com/strings-and-numbers/#a-sample-lesson) and [Arrays & Objects](https://vanillajsguides.com/arrays-and-objects/#a-sample-lesson).
