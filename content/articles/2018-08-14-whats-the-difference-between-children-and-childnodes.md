Today's question comes from [Kieran Barker](https://github.com/kieranbarker):

> Whatâ€™s the difference between the `ParentNode.children` and `Node.childNodes` properties of an element?

Great question! At first glance, they look pretty similar.

```js
var elem = document.querySelector('#my-element');
elem.children;
elem.childNodes;
```

There are some subtle and not-so-subtle differences between the two, though. Understanding those differences will help you decide which one to use, and why.

## Return Type

Neither `ParentNode.children` nor `Node.childNodes` returns an array.

`ParentNode.children` returns an HTMLCollection, while `Node.childNodes` returns a NodeList.

Both of these are *array-like*: they have a set of indexed values and can be looped through with a `for` loop. However, you can't use any of the `Array` methods on either of these, since they're not actually arrays.

```js
var elem = document.querySelector('#my-element');

// This won't work
var newArray1 = elem.children.filter(function (item) {
	// Only show items that have the [data-sandwich] attribute
	return item.hasAttribute('data-sandwich');
});

// This won't either
var newArray2 = elem.childNodes.filter(function (item) {
	// Only show items that have the [data-sandwich] attribute
	return item.hasAttribute('data-sandwich');
});

// You have to do something like this
for (var i = 0; i < elem.children.length; i++) {
	console.log(elem.children[i]);
}
```

In order to use things like `Array.map()`, `Array.filter()`, or `Array.forEach()`, you'd have to [pass the resulting list through `Array.from()`](/converting-a-nodelist-to-an-array-with-vanilla-javascript/) first.

```js
// This works!
var newArray = Array.from(elem.childNodes).filter(function (item) {
	// Only show items that have the [data-sandwich] attribute
	return item.hasAttribute('data-sandwich');
});
```

You *can* [use `NodeList.forEach()`](/looping-through-nodelists-with-es6/) with `Node.childNodes`, however.

```js
// This also works!
// (Don't forget to polyfill NodeList.forEach())
elem.childNodes.forEach(function (item) {
	console.log(item);
});
```

## Returned items

There's another not-so-subtle difference between these two properties: the `ParentNode.children` property only returns child *elements*, while the `Node.childNodes` returns *all child nodes*.

Not sure what the difference is?

`Node.childNodes` also includes text that's not wrapped in an element. `ParentNode.children` does not.

Open up the Console tab in your browsers Developer Tools for [this example demo](https://codepen.io/cferdinandi/pen/VBNGvZ) to see it in action.

`Node.childNodes` also picks up empty text fragments caused by spaces and tabs between elements in your markup, which can be super annoying.

## Which one should you use?

If you need to get *all* content, including stuff that's not wrapped in an element, use `Node.childNodes`. Otherwise, use `ParentNode.children`.
