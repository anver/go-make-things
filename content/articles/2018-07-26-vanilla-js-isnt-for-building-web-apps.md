When I get resistance about using vanilla JS instead of frameworks, I'm often told something like this.

> Well, you probably only build websites. If you built real web apps you'd understand why frameworks are necessary.

First off, fuck your patronizing tone. Second, yes, [I have built "real" web apps](https://courses.gomakethings.com).

But third, and the reason I'm writing this today, Mislav Marohnić from GitHub (definitely a webapp thankyouverymuch) [announced on Twitter yesterday](https://twitter.com/mislav/status/1022058279000842240):

> We’re finally finished removing jQuery from http://GitHub.com  frontend. What did we replace it with? No framework whatsoever:
>
> - querySelectorAll,
> - fetch for ajax,
> - elegated-events for event handling,
> - polyfills for standard DOM stuff,
> - CustomElements on the rise.

👏👏👏

This is so much awesome! Really great work from the GitHub frontend team!
