A few years ago my (not so old at the time) Dell suffered a hard drive failure.

My entire relationship with my wife - from our first date on - was digital. I'd stopped using film years ago. And all those files were on the hard drive that had just failed.

Fortunately, I had just started using a backup drive a month or so earlier, and my data was saved.

But in reading Mat Honan's tale of <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/all/">massive data loss</a> after his iCloud account was hacked and all his devices were remotely wiped, I realized the importance of redundancy in a backup plan. Mat eventually <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/mat-honan-data-recovery/all/">recovered about 80 percent of his data</a> - after spending around $1,700.

There's a simple way to avoid Mat's pain: store duplicate copies of your data.

You can make this really complicated if you want to - with intricate redundant systems - but it doesn't have to be. Two common and simple methods:

<ol>
<li>Use two encrypted backup drives. Keep one at your house and use it weekly, and lock the other in your desk at work. Every month, switch them.</li>
<li>Use a backup drive weekly, and keep it at your house. Then use an automatic service like <a href="http://mozy.com/">Mozy</a> (<em>disclosure: an EMC company</em>) or <a href="http://www.backblaze.com/">Blackblaze</a> to automatically backup your files in the cloud.</li>
</ol>

If you're really serious about avoiding data loss, combine both methods. The important thing to remember is that you shouldn't rely on a single location or drive for your data. Diversify.

Could you still lose data this way? Sure. But you greatly reduce your chances.
