title: Harbor gets Events
---

This week I added Events calendar support to [Harbor, my WordPress theme for animal rescue organizations](http://harbor.gomakethings.com).

Harbor's Events functionality includes...

- Built-in registration buttons
- Auto-generated Google Calendar links and .ics calendar invites
- Timezone support
- Automatically created Google Maps based on the event location
