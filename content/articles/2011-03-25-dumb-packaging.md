My wife and I recently remodeled our kitchen. It came out great!

When we went to install the handles on our cabinets, this is what we found...

<img src="https://gomakethings.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/screws.jpg" alt="" title="screws" width="400" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-246" />

Each handle came with two sets of screws: A longer set for for drawers with thick pieces of wood, and a shorter set for cabinet doors. All good.

Except, rather than putting the two short screws in one bag and the two long screws in another, each handle came with two bags that had one of each. That's dumb.

We only need one type of screw or the other, but now I have to open two bags, and I end up with lots of lose screws floating around.

The details matter.
