One of my constant challenges as someone who *doesn't* navigate the web exclusively with a keyboard, screen reader, or other assistive device is that I don't always know how a component I've built will work for someone who does.

And as my friend and [accessibility specialist Scott O'Hara](https://www.scottohara.me/) points out to me frequently, just because someone's using assistive technology doesn't mean they expect or should get a watered-down web experience.

So, I was delighted to discover [Inclusive Components](https://inclusive-components.design/), a collection of articles and design patterns (and now also [a book](http://book.inclusive-components.design/)) from the amazing [Heydon Pickering](http://www.heydonworks.com/).

*Inclusive Components* features a growing collection of components, including tabbed navigation, tootips, todo lists, and more. Each component includes detailed information around how to properly structure the markup, any aria roles that should be included, proper interaction patterns and expectations with JavaScript, the right CSS to use, and so on.

[This is an amazing resource](https://inclusive-components.design), and I'm so grateful to Heydon for putting it together!
