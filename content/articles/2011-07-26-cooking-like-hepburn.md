I'm not making this up: My friend Emily scored <a href="http://15strawberrylane.com/cast-iron">a set of cast iron skillets and dutch ovens</a> that used to belong to Katherine Hepburn.

<blockquote>TL’s mom used to work for Katharine Hepburn, so when she passed away she left a bunch of stuff to their family. While cleaning out the shed TL found some cast iron skillet’s that just couldn’t wait to come home with him, as well as two awesome Le Crueset french ovens to match our larger blue one.</blockquote>

So cool!
