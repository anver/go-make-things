A few weeks ago, my wife and I went out to dinner with my parents, my grandmother and my brother.

Earlier that day, I'd gone through some old photos I'd scanned into my computer and synced them to my iPhone. In the course of conversation, my mom mentioned something about when my brother was young, and I pulled up an old photo of him.

We spent the next 20 minutes passing the phone around the table flipping through old pictures.

We told stories. We laughed. We got a bit teary eyed when we came to a picture of my late grandfather with my grandma surrounded by all the grandkids.

Near the end of dinner, my brother commented, "Steve Jobs would be really proud right now."

I think he's right. There's something really profound about being able to carry thousands of photos in your pocket. It starts conversations. It brings back memories. Photos freeze time.

This holiday season, I hope you make many wonderful memories you'll look back on fondly years from now. Happy Holidays!
