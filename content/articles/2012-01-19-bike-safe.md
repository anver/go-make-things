Riding a bike is a scary. Last year, a woman took a right-hand turn directly in front of me and almost hit me with her car. People fly by, dangerously close, even on empty roads. Drivers just don't understand the rules of the road as they pertain to cyclists.

A few years back, I had a guy cut me off in his car, and then tell me I had no right to be in the road because "bicycles aren't allowed on highways." He told me this while stopped at a red light. Not on a highway.

After a few experiences like that, and <a href="http://alancolville.org/2011/02/in-the-saddle/">Alan Colville's collision with a car</a> last year, I find myself riding far less... and I live in the suburbs! I can't imagine being a cyclist in the city.

Boston-based lawyer Josh Zisson has put together a <a href="http://bikesafeboston.com/">cyclist accident report</a>.

It's a simple form for capturing important information if you find yourself in a run-in with a car. It also includes a Bicyclist's Bill of Rights - a list of important rules of the road for cyclists.

It's currently for Boston only, but Josh plans to scale it out to all 50 states. Learn more at <a href="http://bikesafeboston.com/">BikeSafeBoston.com</a>.
