Illustrator [Katerina Limpitsouni](https://twitter.com/ninalimpi) recently launched [unDraw](https://undraw.co/illustrations), a gorgeous collection of illustrations that fit almost any project you can think of.

The whole project is MIT licensed, with is absurdly generous considering the quality of the graphics. Each image is available in SVG and high quality PNG, and you can even tweak the colors to fit your project.

There's only two small things I'd love to see improved:

1. There's no search yet, so it's a scroll and look kind of thing right now.
2. All of the "not white" looking people primarily appear only in multi-person animations. I'd love to see a greater variety of skin tones, particularly among the "one-person" illustrations.

Regardless, this is a wonderful project and I'm grateful for all of Katerina's work and generosity in releasing it.
