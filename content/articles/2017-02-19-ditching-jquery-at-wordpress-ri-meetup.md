I'm giving a talk on how to ditch jQuery for vanilla JS at the [WordPress RI Meetup on March 14, 2017](https://www.meetup.com/WordPressRI/events/236735446/).

If you're in the Providence, RI area, I'd love for you to come check it out. It's 100% free.

The talk is based on [my book (and upcoming course) of the same name](https://ditchingjquery.com).
