Two weeks ago, I had a discussion with <a href="https://twitter.com/jon_hyland">Jon Hyland</a> on the extreme opinions that the talking heads of the blogosphere seem to take.

I realized that as I get older, I find myself being bothered by idealistically polarized views (even those I myself had just a few years ago).

Jon had a really nice way of phrasing it...

<blockquote>I've learned when you paint things black & white you miss the beautiful shades of gray.</blockquote>

... and so many colors in between!
