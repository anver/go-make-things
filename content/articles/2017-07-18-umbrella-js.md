If you're looking to transition to vanilla JS but aren't ready to go all-in, [Umbrella JS](https://umbrellajs.com/) may be a nice stepping stone for you.

It weight just 3kb minified (even smaller if you gzip your files), and provides a jQuery-like syntax with far less bloat.

Unlike jQuery, elements you get using the Umbrella selector (the Umbrella JS equivalent of `$`) are native nodes. This means you can use native JavaScript methods on them (something you can't do with jQuery objects).
