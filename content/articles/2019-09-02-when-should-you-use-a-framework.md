I advocate for using [native browser APIs and JavaScript methods](https://vanillajstoolkit.com/) whenever you can.

But there are situations where I think it's ok to use a library or framework.

- **When you're learning**, if these tools help you go from zero to coding faster or let you grok concepts you otherwise couldn't, that's a good thing. Learning inertia is really important!
- **When the thing literally wouldn't exist otherwise**, because you lack the skills to build it without a library or framework. Obviously, focus on building your skills, but that doesn't happen overnight.
- **When the native approach requires a lot of boilerplate/code around it.** Image sliders come to mind here.

Bad reasons for using a library or framework include...

- Because you can’t be bothered to learn more about native methods/APIs.
- Because “it’s what everyone else uses.”

Unfortunately, these are often the reasons why people use these tools.
