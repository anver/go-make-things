I found myself nodding along to every single word in [Jeremy Keith's recent post, "Split"](https://adactio.com/journal/15050):

> As a user-centred developer, my priority is doing what’s best for end users. That’s not to say I don’t value [developer convenience](https://jeremy.codes/blog/defining-productivity/). I do. [But I *prioritise* user needs over developer needs.](https://adactio.com/journal/13333) And in any case, those two needs don’t even come into conflict most of the time. Like I said, from a user’s point of view, it’s irrelevant what text editor or version control system you use...

> Where it gets interesting is when a technology that’s designed for developer convenience is made out of the very materials being delivered to users. For example, a CSS framework like Bootstrap is made of CSS. That’s different to a tool like Sass which outputs CSS. Whether or not a developer chooses to use Sass is irrelevant to the user—the final output will be CSS either way. But if a developer chooses to use a CSS framework, that decision has a direct impact on the user experience. The user must download the framework in order for the developer to get the benefit.

> So whereas Sass sits at the back of the front end—where I don’t care what you use—Bootstrap sits at the front of the front end. For tools like that, I don’t think saying “use whatever works for you” is good enough. It’s got to be weighed against the cost to the user.
