title: Tim Cook on great products and changing your mind
---

Businessweek conducted an excellent <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-12-06/tim-cooks-freshman-year-the-apple-ceo-speaks">interview with Apple CEO Tim Cook</a>. Here are a few of my favorite quotes...

<h2>On Great Products</h2>

<blockquote>You could almost place every product that we [make] on this table. I mean, if you really look at it, we have four iPods. We have two main iPhones. We have two iPads, and we have a few Macs. That’s it. And we argue and debate like crazy about what we’re going to do, because we know that we can only do a few things great. That means not doing a bunch of things that would be really good and really fun. That’s a part of our base principle, that we will only do a few things. And we’ll only do things where we can make a significant contribution.

<h2>On Doing Great Work</h2>

<blockquote>There’s more pressure that comes from within than from the outside. Our customers have an incredibly high bar for us. We have an even higher bar for ourselves. So we want to do great work, and yeah, people are always talking about what we may do next and when it might happen, but honestly we’re driven much more internally by great people who want to do great work.

<h2>On Changing Your Mind</h2>

<blockquote>More so than any person I ever met in my life, [Steve Jobs] had the ability to change his mind, much more so than anyone I’ve ever met. He could be so sold on a certain direction and in a nanosecond (Cook snaps his fingers) have a completely different view. I thought in the early days, “Wow, this is strange.” Then I realized how much of a gift it was. So many people, particularly, I think, CEOs and top executives, they get so planted in their old ideas, and they refuse or don’t have the courage to admit that they’re now wrong. Maybe the most underappreciated thing about Steve was that he had the courage to change his mind.
