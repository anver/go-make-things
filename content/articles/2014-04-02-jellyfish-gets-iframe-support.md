title: Jellyfish gets iframe support
---

Over the weekend I added iframe support to [Jellyfish](http://cferdinandi.github.io/jellyfish/).

In addition to images, you can now lazy load YouTube and Vimeo videos, SlideShare presentations and more. Jellyfish also picked up new callbacks and more options, making it easier for you to customize it for your projects.
