Last week I talked about the power of having <a href="https://gomakethings.com/1000-photos-in-your-pocket/">a 1,000 photos in your pocket</a>. I've been thinking a lot about what types of events and stories better lend themselves to photos than video (and vice versa).

<strong>One thing that's jumped out at me over the last few weeks is the ability of photos to freeze time.</strong>

When you watch a video, you're not in control. The creator of the video is. They determine how long each scene plays for. They control what you see and when. With a photo, you can look at for as long (or as little) as you'd like. You can take in every detail. You can get lost in the moment.

A few weeks ago, I showed my grandfather an old photo of him playing guitar (pictured above). He exclaimed, "That was in Canada!" Then, I watched him get lost in a sea of memories. It was a beautiful moment.

Photos freeze time. It's a magical thing.
