On Friday, I quietly launched a new website: [the Vanilla JavaScript Toolkit](https://vanillajstoolkit.com).

The Vanilla JS Toolkit is a growing collection of code snippets, helper functions, polyfills, plugins, and learning resources. Over the last five years, I've built up a private collection of cheat sheets, snippets, and favorites, and decided to open source it all so that you can use it on your projects, too.

I turn to this often when I'm writing code. I hope you find it as useful as I do.

If you have any questions, comments, or feedback, please [reach out](/about) and let me know!
