I love every single word of every single sentence in [this post from Thomas Fuchs about making things for the web](https://medium.com/@thomasfuchs/so-ive-been-making-web-stuff-for-a-quarter-of-a-century-now-f3dab31570cf) over the last 25 years.

> I’m not a Luddite, however it’s a good idea to reflect sometimes if you actually need all the crap that supposedly makes things “better”.
>
> Does it, objectively, improve lives of users?
>
> Does more code and more complexity really make things easier to maintain? (The idea of componentized architectures pops up every half decade or so—is it really going to last this time? What’s different this time around?)
>
> If you want to be really great at making web sites and apps—forget about frameworks.
>
> These are and always will be ephemeral.
>
> To be good at “Web” you’ll need to understand first and foremost about humans.
>
> Any web site or web app is ultimately always about a human being wanting to achieve something.

If this ideas sound familiar, Thomas is also the guy who coined the term "[the lean web](https://gomakethings.com/the-lean-web/)."

Seriously, [go read the whole thing](https://medium.com/@thomasfuchs/so-ive-been-making-web-stuff-for-a-quarter-of-a-century-now-f3dab31570cf).
