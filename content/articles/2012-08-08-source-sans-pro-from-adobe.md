title: Source Sans Pro from Adobe
---

Last week Adobe released <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2012/08/source-sans-pro.html">Source Sans Pro</a>, it's first ever open source font offering.

There are tons of free font offerings out there, but this is a big deal. Most free fonts aren't all that good. There are some hidden gems from indie font developers, but they're hard to find and very rare.

Source Sans Pro is gorgeous, well designed, and works well at a variety of sizes. It's available for <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sourcesans.adobe/files/">direct download from SourceForge</a>, as well as font embedding services like <a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/source-sans-pro">TypeKit</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro">Google Web Fonts</a>.

This is a sure addition to future web projects for me. <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2012/08/source-sans-pro.html">Learn more on the Adobe blog.</a>
