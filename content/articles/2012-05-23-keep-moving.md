title: Keep Moving

<blockquote>Inspiration is like some sort of weird collision, where the idea is always sweeping across the landscape, through the neighborhood, or in and out the bedroom window. For that idea to hit you, you must be moving as well. If youâ€™re standing still, the idea will whip right around you and keep going. It is like some sort of weird reverse game of chicken, where the sole way to make contact is by trying to miss one another.
