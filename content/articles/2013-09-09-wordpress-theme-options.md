<a href="http://cferdinandi.github.io/wp-theme-options/">WordPress Theme Options</a> is a simple boilerplate you can use to build a customized theme options page for your clients.

When I redesigned Boston-area photographer <a href="http://www.tonyluong.com/">Tony Luong's website</a> a few months ago, I wanted to make sure he could easily add his Google Analytics script, change footer text, and adjust the compression level for his photos without me.

Michael Fields shared an awesome <a href="https://gist.github.com/mfields/4678999">sample theme options page on GitHub</a> that I used to build Tony a page where he could customize the settings of his site. While Michael's script is awesome, it was a little light on documentation.

<a href="http://cferdinandi.github.io/wp-theme-options/">WordPress Theme Options</a> is a fork of Michael's work that features detailed documentation and a start-to-finish example of how you might use it on a project. <a href="http://cferdinandi.github.io/wp-theme-options/">Download it on GitHub.</a>
