<a href="http://cferdinandi.github.io/web-app-starter-kit/">WordPress for Web Apps</a> picked up a new feature over the weekend. Users can now delete their account from the front-end.

The button <em>doesn't</em> include any sort of confirmation message or verification, so you should add your own. You might have an initial "Delete Account" button that opens a <a href="http://cferdinandi.github.io/modals/">modal window</a>, a <a href="http://cferdinandi.github.io/houdini/">drop-down menu</a>, or a new page where the real delete button resides.

Enjoy!
