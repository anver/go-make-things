The `this` keyword in JavaScript is the source of a lot of confusion.

[It's context specific](https://javascriptforwp.com/this-introduction/), and changes based on when and where it's called. [Here are some examples.](https://codepen.io/cferdinandi/pen/rRaMLE)

```js
// logs the window
console.log('global', this);

var logThis = function () {
	// also logs the window
	console.log('logThis', this);
};
logThis();

var LogThis = function () {
	// logs the LogThis() constructor
	console.log('LogThis', this);
};
new LogThis();

var myLibrary = {
	logThis: function () {
		// logs the myLibrary object
		console.log('myLibrary.logThis', this);
	},
	logThis2: () => {
		// logs the window
		// `this` doesn't change its binding in fat arrow functions
		console.log('myLibrary.logThis2', this);
	}
};
myLibrary.logThis();
myLibrary.logThis2();
```

## `this` sucks

Some developers love `this` and use it anywhere they can. I think it sucks, and should be avoided whenever possible.

To me, there's almost always some other variable you can use that's more clear.

```js
var logThis = function () {
	// The log the same thing, but with the second option,
	// it's immediately obvious what will be logged
	console.log(this);
	console.log(window);
};
logThis();

var myLibrary = {
	logThis: function () {
		// Same here. They both log the same thing.
		// The second choice is much more obvious
		console.log(this);
		console.log(myLibrary);
	}
};
myLibrary.logThis();
```

In both examples above, using a named variable instead of `this` makes it far more clear what you're actually doing.

## Should you *ever* use `this`?

There is one situation where I *do* use `this`, and think it makes sense to do so.

With [a *constructor pattern*](https://vanillajstoolkit.com/boilerplates/constructor/), you can instantiate multiple instances of your constructor, each with its own properties and values.

The `this` keyword represents the current instantiation, and is the best choice for accurately using that instance's unique properties and values.

```js
var sayHi = function (greeting) {
	this.greeting = greeting;
};

sayHi.prototype.greet = function () {
	alert(this.greeting);
};

var hi = new sayHi('Hi there!');
var aloha = new sayHi('Aloha');

hi.greet();
```
