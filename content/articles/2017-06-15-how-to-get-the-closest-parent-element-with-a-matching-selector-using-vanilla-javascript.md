***Note:*** *There's [an update version of this article](https://gomakethings.com/a-native-vanilla-javascript-way-to-get-the-closest-matching-parent-element/).*

One thing I need to do a lot in my plugins is find a parent element with a particular selector.

For example, when someone clicks on a link in an accordion, I need to get the parent container for all of the other content sections. I don't always know exactly what the markup structure will look like, so I can't just use `.parentNode` to get it.

```lang-markup
<div class="accordion">
	<div>
		<a class="accordion-toggle" href="#content-1">Content 1</a>
		<div id="content-1">Some content.</div>
	</div>
	<div>
		<a class="accordion-toggle" href="#content-2">Content 2</a>
		<div id="content-2">More content.</div>
	</div>
	<div>
		<a class="accordion-toggle" href="#content-3">Content 3</a>
		<div id="content-3">Even more content.</div>
	</div>
</div>
```

In this example, when someone clicks an `.accordion-toggle` link, I want to get the `.accordion` element, but I don't neccessarily know how many nested `div`'s will be in the markup.

## Creating a helper function

To do this, we can setup a `for` loop to climb up the DOM. On each loop, we'll grab the element's `.parentNode` and see if it has our selector. If it doesn't, we'll jump to the next `.parentNode` and repeat.

First, let's setup a helper function.

```lang-javascript
var getClosest = function () {
	// Code goes here...
};
```

Next, let's create our loop.

```lang-javascript
var getClosest = function (elem) {
	for ( ; elem && elem !== document; elem = elem.parentNode ) {
		// Do something...
	}
};
```

Normally, you'd set a variable in the first part of your for loop (something like `var i = 0`), but we don't need any for this loop.

The next part (between the two semicolons) is where we evaluate our criteria for continuing the loop. We want to make sure that an `elem` exists and that it's not the `document` element (which means we've reached the top of the page with no results).

Finally, the last part (after the second semicolon) is where we tell the loop what to do after each iteration. We want to set the `elem` variable to the current element's parent (this is how we climb up the DOM).

## Matching by selector

Inside our loop, we want to check and see if the current element matches our selector. For a class we might use `classList`. For an ID we'd use `elem.id === 'our-id'`. And so on. To make things easy, though, let's use the `.matches()` method, which checks any valid CSS selector.

```lang-javascript
var getClosest = function (elem, selector) {
	for ( ; elem && elem !== document; elem = elem.parentNode ) {
		if ( elem.matches( selector ) ) return elem;
	}
	return null;
};
```

If there's a matching element, our helper function will return it. If it makes it through the whole loop without a match, it returns `null`.

## Browser compatibility

There's one last thing we need to do, though. Many browsers implemented `.matches()` with proprietary prefixes. Others didn't implement it but support `querySelectorAll`. In both cases, a lightweight polyfill bolts in `.matches()` support.

```lang-javascript
var getClosest = function (elem, selector) {

	// Element.matches() polyfill
	if (!Element.prototype.matches) {
	    Element.prototype.matches =
	        Element.prototype.matchesSelector ||
	        Element.prototype.mozMatchesSelector ||
	        Element.prototype.msMatchesSelector ||
	        Element.prototype.oMatchesSelector ||
	        Element.prototype.webkitMatchesSelector ||
	        function(s) {
	            var matches = (this.document || this.ownerDocument).querySelectorAll(s),
	                i = matches.length;
	            while (--i >= 0 && matches.item(i) !== this) {}
	            return i > -1;
	        };
	}

	// Get the closest matching element
	for ( ; elem && elem !== document; elem = elem.parentNode ) {
		if ( elem.matches( selector ) ) return elem;
	}
	return null;

};
```

This gives you browser support back to at least IE9.

## Putting it all together

Now you can do something like this:

```lang-javascript
document.addEventListener('click', function (event) {

	// If the clicked item is an `.accordion-toggle` get the parent `.accordion`
	if ( event.target.classList.contains('accordion-toggle') ) {

		// Get the parent with the `.accordion` class
		var parent = getClosest(event.target, '.accordion');

	}

}, false);
```

Now that you know how this works, you could modify it to things like:

1. Get all matching parents (not just the first).
2. Get all parent elements and push them to an array.
3. Get all parent elements *until* you find one that matches a selector.
4. And more!
