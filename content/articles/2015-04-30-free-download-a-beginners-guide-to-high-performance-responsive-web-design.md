Yesterday, I released [Wicked Fast Websites](/wicked-fast-websites/), an 89-page, 100% free crash course in high-performance responsive web design. If you’re looking to build fast websites and web apps that work on any device, this is the guide for you.

Available as a PDF, EPUB, or MOBI, it works on whatever device you've got on hand. [Learn more or download it today.](/wicked-fast-websites/)
