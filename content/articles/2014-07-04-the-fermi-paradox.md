Wait But Why takes [an interesting look at the Fermi Paradox](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html)—why we haven't found any signs of other life in the universe despite the high mathematical odds that it exists.

> We have no answer to the Fermi Paradox—the best we can do is “possible explanations.” And if you ask ten different scientists what their hunch is about the correct one, you’ll get ten different answers. You know when you hear about humans of the past debating whether the Earth was round or if the sun revolved around the Earth or thinking that lightning happened because of Zeus, and they seem so primitive and in the dark? That’s about where we are with this topic.

The whole post is [well worth a read](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html).
