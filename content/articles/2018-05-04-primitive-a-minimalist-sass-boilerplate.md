Tania Rascia is a developer, designer, and writer [who teaches people how to code](https://www.taniarascia.com/).

I just learned about Primitive, an awesome open source project of her's.

[Primitive is a minimalist Sass boilerplate](http://taniarascia.github.io/primitive/) loosely based on [my Kraken CSS boilerplate](https://cferdinandi.github.io/kraken/) with some nice enhancements and out-of-the-box defaults.

And if you were born in the 80s like me and love a good 8-bit logo, the website for the project will tickle you pink.
