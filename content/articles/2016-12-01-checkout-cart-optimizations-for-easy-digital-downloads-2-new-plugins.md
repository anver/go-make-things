title: Checkout cart optimizations for Easy Digital Downloads (2 new plugins)
---

Yesterday I released two new plugins designed to optimize the checkout experience with Easy Digital Downloads:

1. **[EDD Add Link to Products in Cart.](https://github.com/cferdinandi/gmt-edd-add-link-to-product-in-cart)** Let's you add links back to your product description pages in the Easy Digital Downloads checkout cart.
2. **[EDD Redirect on Empty Cart.](https://github.com/cferdinandi/gmt-edd-redirect-on-empty-cart)** Redirect Easy Digital Downloads from your checkout cart to another page when the cart is empty.

Both are available on GitHub. Enjoy!
