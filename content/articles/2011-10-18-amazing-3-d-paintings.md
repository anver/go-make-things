title: Amazing 3-D Paintings
---

Theo Prins makes amazing 3D paintings. Here's how to view them:

<ol>
<li>Cross your eyes. A third image should appear in the middle.</li>
<li>Keep them crossed.</li>
<li>Move your face closer to (or farther from) the screen until the middle image becomes 3-dimensional.</li>
</ol>

The two images depict the same picture from two slightly different angles. Crossing your eyes superimposes them on top of each other, creating an illusion of depth.
