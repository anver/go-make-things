title: 'Must Watch YouTube: The PBS Idea Channel'
---

Of all the items in my RSS reader (aww, <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html">good bye Google Reader</a>!), the thing I most look forward to each week is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/pbsideachannel">PBS Idea Channel video</a>.

Every week, host Mike Rugnetta mixes pop culture references, nerdiness, and a healthy dose of ADD with some really interesting ideas and insights. I always learn something new and have my thinking on something challenged a bit. It's pure nerdy bliss.

Seriously, subscribe to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/pbsideachannel">this YouTube channel</a>!
