I have a confession to make. I don't actually test my JavaScript across browsers all that much.

Instead, I rely on a mix of [feature detection](/javascript-feature-detection/) and [polyfills](https://vanillajstoolkit.com/polyfills/) to progressively enhance JavaScript features on my sites and apps.

That said, every now and then I do need to figure out why something is acting weird in one specific browser or device.

And for that, I use [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/). It let's you test webpages in real browsers on real devices, and makes the whole thing super easy.

It's a bit pricey, so I often spin it up for just a month as needed. They also offer a free trial.
