title: Accessibility (according to people with actual disabilities)

Last week, [Safia Abdalla tweeted](https://twitter.com/captainsafia/status/871056480799162368):

> I'm curious to know: if you have a disability, what's the hardest thing about browsing the web?

She received a bunch of awesome responses, and [summarized the common themes in a blog post](https://axesslab.com/accessibility-according-to-pwd/).

If you build things for the web, this is essential reading. Like, right now. Seriously, go read it right now.

Here are a few of the things that really stood out for me.

## Large blocks of text are challenging for people with certain cognitive impairments (including things like ADHD)

> Huge paragraphs. A page on Wikipedia often consists of many long paragraphs with long sentences. I lose my place within seconds.<cite>- <a href="https://twitter.com/AvaJarvisArt/status/871057896267694080">Ava Jarvis Art</a></cite>

This one was a surprise to me. Fortunately, my passion for super small paragraphs (something that drove my English teacher nuts) is a boon on the web.

## Small text sucks

This isn't a surprise to me, but... I often hear people talk about how easy it is to zoom in on modern browsers.

> Fonts are often too small and sites break when I increase font sizes.

> My daughter has low vision and has to use 300-500% magnification. Many web sites are hard to navigate at this level

## Color edge-cases

I've written [a handful of articles about proper user of color](https://gomakethings.com/?s=colorblind), and how link color affects colorblind visitors' ability to use your site.

One thing I've taken for granted is that the color blue I use on many of my sites provides good contrast for colorblind individuals. However, people who use certain color-shifting apps [may run into issues with blue links](https://twitter.com/tigt_/status/871061632155340800) (a surprise to me).

> Sleep disorder: I have to read after 5pm with f.lux cranked up all the way, so sites that assume hyperlinks can be blue w/no underline...

## Even more!

This was just a surface skim. There's *so* much good stuff in that post. [Go read it now!](https://axesslab.com/accessibility-according-to-pwd/)
