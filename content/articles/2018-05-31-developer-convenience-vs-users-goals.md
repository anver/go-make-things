In response to my article about [my biggest challenge as a web developer](/my-biggest-challenge-with-javascript/), reader [Orde Saunders](https://decadecity.net/) shared this with me:

> The difference I see between React and RWD is that RWD was a user focused change rather than a developer or technology focused change. I suspect there will be parts of React that will become subsumed into the way the web develops&mdash;much as happened with jQuery&mdash;but RWD worked with what was already there and solved a very real user problem.

I could not agree more.

[Some more gold from Orde:](https://decadecity.net/blog/2018/05/18/user-agent-as-a-runtime)

> There are more things about this environment that are out of your control than are within it - the range of browsers, operating systems, hardware, networks, AdBlockers, &c. is vast... Ultimately you can't control when and how things go wrong but you do have some control over what happens. This is why progressive enhancement exists.

And related, [this short article from Jim Newbery](https://tinnedfruit.com/list/20180530). My favorite excerpt:

> My colleague argued that anything that makes developers happier and more productive will eventually propagate to better outcomes for the end user and business.
>
> But I couldn’t see how this would always be the case. This argument assumes that the interests of developers will always be aligned with the interests of other constituents.
>
> If this were true we wouldn’t see products with beautiful code fail because there was no value in them for users. And we wouldn’t sacrifice performance in the name of over-engineered frameworks and bloated off-the-shelf solutions.

What do you think?
