I recently recorded a few screencasts to go along with the projects in my new book, *[Ditching jQuery](https://gomakethings.com/ditching-jquery-book)*.

The first one is on [how to build a simple show-and-hide script with vanilla JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VfNGVy17Xk). If you like this, the rest of the screencasts are only available with the book. [Check it out.](https://gomakethings.com/ditching-jquery-book)
