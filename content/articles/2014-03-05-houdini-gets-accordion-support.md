title: Houdini gets accordion support
---

<a href="http://cferdinandi.github.io/houdini/">Houdini</a>, my simple expand-and-collapse script, now supports accordion groups.

Add a <code>data-group</code> data attribute to every toggle in the accordion, and make sure they all have the same name. Houdini will sort out the rest.
