On January 23, I'll be at [the Boston CSS Meetup talking about the Lean Web](https://www.meetup.com/Boston-CSS/events/257820788/).

The web is a mess of bloat and over-engineering. I'll be sharing some ideas on how we can fix it.

If you're in the Boston area that day, come check it out and say hi. It will also, from what I understand, be live-streamed and posted on YouTube later, if you can't attend.
