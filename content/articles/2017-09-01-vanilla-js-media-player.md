Jonathan Neal, the guy behind [polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io) and [a whole bunch of other awesome stuff](http://jonathantneal.github.io/) just released his latest project: [Media Player](https://github.com/jonathantneal/media-player).

Most JavaScript media players are large and overcomplicated, and often have third-party dependencies. For example, the very popular [Video.js](http://videojs.com/), which I've worked with before, is 250kb minified.

Media Player is tiny (just 2kb minified), accessible, works cross-browser, and is super customizable.

[Check out it out](https://github.com/jonathantneal/media-player) next time you need a media player for audio or video on a project.
