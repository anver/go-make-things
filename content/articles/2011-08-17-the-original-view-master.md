Growing up, one of my favorite toys was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View-Master">View-Master</a>. So I was pretty excited when my wife's cousin found a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy">stereoscope</a> from the mid-1800's in his grandparent's closet a few months ago.

<img src="https://gomakethings.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/DSC00502.jpg" alt="" title="Stereoscope Cards" width="466" height="350" class="size-medium wp-image-907" />

Each card has two nearly identical photos taken from different angles. You place the card in a holder on the end of the viewfinder, and slide the card forward or backwards until the two images become one. Because each eye is viewing the image from a slightly different perspective, a foreground and background emerge.

It's the original View-Master!
