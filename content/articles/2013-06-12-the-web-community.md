One of my favorite things about transitioning from my previous profession into the world of web design and development is how open, welcoming and helpful the web community is.

Today, I wanted to take just a minute to thank a few folks who, whether they realize it or not, helped me get to where I am today.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://css-tricks.com/">Chris Coyier of CSS Tricks</a>. His <a href="http://css-tricks.com/designing-for-wordpress-complete-series-downloads/">Designing for WordPress series</a> kick-started my foray into WordPress and PHP development.</li>
<li><a href="http://elliotjaystocks.com/">Elliot Jay Stocks</a>, whose original <a href="http://viewportindustries.com/products/starkers/">Starkers theme</a> was the foundation of many of my early custom designs.</li>
<li><a href="http://trentwalton.com/">Trent Walton</a>, whose article on <a href="http://trentwalton.com/2013/01/07/flexible-foundations/">Flexible Foundations</a> finally convinced me to go 100% fluid and relative sizing.</li>
<li><a href="http://daverupert.com/">Dave Rupert</a>, who built <a href="https://github.com/davatron5000/Foldy960">Foldy</a>, the grid that I forked into <a href="http://cferdinandi.github.io/kraken/">Kraken</a> and use on every single one of my projects.</li>
<li><a href="http://markdotto.com/">Mark Otto</a>, whose <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap framework</a> helped me wrap my head around <a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/12/an-introduction-to-object-oriented-css-oocss/">OOCSS</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://bradfrostweb.com/">Brad Frost</a>, who introduced me to mobile-first, progressive-enhancement, and got me writing my own simple jQuery scripts.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.elezea.com/">Rian van der Merwe</a>, who constantly makes me rethink user experience and how we interact with technology.</li>
<li><a href="http://toddmotto.com/">Todd Motto</a>, for making JavaScript accessible instead of scary.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/keithtri">Keith Rousseau</a>, who tells me when my stuff sucks and how to do it better.</li>
<li>The entire <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow community</a>, for helping me work through countless quirks, bugs and issues along the way.</li>
</ul>

I know I missed some awesome folks. If you're one of them, I'm really sorry, and I promise it's bad memory and not a deliberate omission.
