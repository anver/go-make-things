excerpt: Another look at Massively Open Online Courses.
title: MOOCs Redux
---

As a follow-up to <a href="https://gomakethings.com/moocs-and-the-future-of-higher-education/">my post the other week</a> on Massively Open Online Courses (aka MOOCs), <a href="http://nation.time.com/2012/10/18/college-is-dead-long-live-college/">Time Magazine ran an article</a> on them that contained this insight...

<blockquote>This fall, to glimpse the future of higher education, I visited classes in brick-and-mortar colleges and enrolled in half a dozen MOOCs. I dropped most of the latter because they were not very good. Or rather, they would have been fine in person, nestled in a 19th century hall at Princeton University, but online, they could not compete with the other distractions on my computer.</blockquote>

That's not to say that MOOCs can't or won't be succesful, but that many of them - including many of the elearnings and webinars I've been to - just aren't well designed for remote, digital consumption.

Which begs the question, what does a well designed elearning look like? What do you think?
