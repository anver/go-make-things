[From the Sarasota Patch](http://patch.com/florida/sarasota/90-year-old-man-arrested-again-feeding-homeless-0):

> The brouhaha over Abbott’s determination to feed the hungry erupted Sunday when Abbott and two local pastors were arrested for feeding people in Fort Lauderdale’s Stranahan Park. Abbott is the founder of Love Thy Neighbor, a local nonprofit that helps the homeless. He’d only handed out a few of the 300 meals he had prepared when police told him to stop or else... Fort Lauderdale passed a new law Oct. 22 that bans public food sharing.

Shame on you, Fort Lauderdale.
