title: Kraken for WordPress and more
---

Last week I released <a href="http://github.com/cferdinandi/kraken-for-wordpress/">Kraken for WordPress 3</a>. Version 3 brings with it some important changes:<!--more-->

<ul>
<li>Many of the built-in functions have been converted to optional plugins. This provides developers with more flexibility, and makes it easier to port your data from one theme to another.</li>
<li>Deprecated functions were removed or updated.</li>
<li>Tabs are now used consistently throughout the theme.</li>
<li>Internationalization was added to whole theme&mdash;it's now 100% translation-ready.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New Plugins</h2>

With the change, a handful of functions that were baked into Kraken for WordPress are now available as standalone plugins.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://github.com/cferdinandi/html-minify/">HTML Minify</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/cferdinandi/google-analytics/">Google Analytics</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/cferdinandi/remove-header-junk/">Remove Header Junk</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/cferdinandi/no-self-pings/">No Self-Pings</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/cferdinandi/exclude-from-search/">Exclude from Search</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/cferdinandi/remove-trackbacks/">Remove Trackbacks</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/cferdinandi/antispambot/">Antispambot (NEW!)</a></li>
</ul>

Enjoy!
