A few weeks ago, I switched from Google Chrome to Firefox as my primary browser for both casual browsing *and* development. You should, too.

## Why I made the switch

[Google Chrome now accounts for about 65% of all web traffic](https://www.netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx), and I would imagine the percentage among web developers is even higher.

There are two problems with this:

1. We as a community end up building a lot of things that work well in Chrome but treat all other browsers like second-class citizens.
2. It stifles innovation in the browser market.

I'm also trying to scale back just how much of my life Google has hooks in. Using Chrome gives Google permission to track every single web page you visit. Firefox has some really nice privacy features.

But what really pushed me over the edge was news that Chrome was possibly going to make changes that would break how ad blockers work.

## Switching is hard

Some folks found the move easy, but I personally found it really difficult.

Firefox seems to generally startup faster, crash less, and be less of a resource hog. But it's not optimized for JS rendering quite as nicely, with more flashes of unstyled content that I experience in Chrome.

I also find the UI of Chrome to be more "lightweight" and visually pleasing.

In the Console tab in dev tools, Chrome has some clear advantages, too. Most notably:

- Hinting and output previews as you type are *really* nice and better done in Chrome.
- Expanding a logged element to the console in Chrome let's you dig into its tree. In Firefox, it only exposes it's properties.

Generally speaking, I find debugging JS easier in Chrome.

## Where Firefox wins

Firefox is the hands down winner in privacy. Their Facebook Container extension, for example, keeps your Facebook browsing isolated from everything else so they can't track you across the web (those cretins!).

Firefox is also very customizable, in ways that Chrome cannot be. Dev tools is better than Chrome in some ways for CSS work.

And one thing I absolutely love is how engaged int he community Firefox developers are. I've tweeted various issues and challenges, and someone from the team has on several occasions reached out to learn more or helped me through some things.

Also, Firefox's default theme changes to match *Dark Mode* in MacOS when enabled.

I've made a few small tweaks, but am generally rocking the out-of-the-box Firefox experience. I use the stable version. I didn't see any meaningful benefits to Nightly or Developer Edition.

## I still crave Chrome sometimes

If I'm being honest, every now and then I fire up Chrome for something and feel the itch to switch back.

But Firefox is a great browser from a great company, and I'm really enjoying using it. I've hit a point where certain things about Chrome bug me a little bit, too.
