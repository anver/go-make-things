title: Speaking at WordCamp Boston in a few weeks
---

I'll be delivering my talk on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/cferdinandi/wicked-fast-wordpress">Wicked Fast WordPress</a> at <a href="http://2013.boston.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Boston</a> this year.

WordCamp Boston runs from October 25 to 27 this year. I'm not sure which day I'll be speaking yet.

These events are awesome. Not only is the content going to be amazing, but tickets are really affordable. It's just $60 for all three days (including a 4-hour workshop on Friday). You can also buy just a weekend pass for $40, or a workshop-only ticket for $20.

Hope to see you there!
