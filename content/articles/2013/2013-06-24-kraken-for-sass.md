Major kudos to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jwebcat">Jupiter St. John</a>, who created a fork of <a href="http://jwebcat.github.io/kraken-sass/">Kraken for Sass</a> over the last few weeks.

Kraken-Sass makes it easier than ever to modify the <a href="http://cferdinandi.github.io/kraken/">Kraken boilerplate</a> for your projects. Just change a few variables in the <code>_config.scss</code> and you're up and running. It even includes all of the Kraken add-ons bundled in and Sassified.

If you're a Ruby on Rails user, be sure to also check out the <a href="https://github.com/PendragonDevelopment/krakenrails">Kraken Rails Gem</a> by <a href="http://www.jordankburke.com/">Jordan Burke</a>.
