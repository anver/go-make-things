title: WordPress for Web Apps, version 2
---

When I built <a href="https://gomakethings.com/projects/jetpack/">JetPack</a> last year, I used WordPress to handle the user and content management so I could focus on building a great experience. Right now, I'm working on another app - a scavenger hunt for new hires - and I'm using WordPress again.

As part of my new project, I've rebuilt my <a href="http://cferdinandi.github.io/web-app-starter-kit/">WordPress for Web Apps toolkit</a> from the ground up.

WordPress for Web Apps is a collection of functions, templates and plugins that transform WordPress into a web app engine. It comes with the essential components you need to power your web app with WordPress:

<ul>
<li>A login form.</li>
<li>A sign-up form.</li>
<li>A password reset form.</li>
<li>A password change form.</li>
<li>Templates for content that can only be viewed while logged in (or logged out).</li>
<li>A customized registration email.</li>
<li>A disabled admin bar for all users.</li>
<li>No access to the back-end for anyone except admins.</li>
<li>User-specific navigation.</li>
<li>A logout link.</li>
</ul>
