As a nice follow-up to yesterday's article on [the cost of JavaScript frameworks](/the-cost-of-javascript-frameworks/), my buddy Scott Jehl is working on a new course: [Lightning-Fast Web Performance](https://scottjehl.com/lfwp/).

> Learn to analyze site performance, fix issues, monitor for regressions, and deliver fast, responsive designs from the start.

Scott really knows his stuff, and this is going to be a great program.

The course is still in development, but you can get notified when it launches by [signing up for notifications here](https://scottjehl.com/lfwp/).
