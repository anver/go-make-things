Today, I just wanted to take a quick look at what my 2019 looked like, and what I've got planned for 2020.

## What went well in 2019

I got a bunch of stuff done in 2019 that I'm particularly proud of...

<div class="list-spaced">
{{%md%}}
- I rewrote a handful of [my vanilla JS pocket guides](https://vanillajsguides.com/) to include new ES6 methods and techniques, and provide more clarity.
- I completely redesigned the [Vanilla JS Academy](https://vanillajsacademy.com/). It's my best selling product, and that was a bit scary, but I ended up nearly quadrupling enrollment with the new program!
- I created a manifesto around building a simpler, faster world-wide web, loving called [the Lean Web](https://leanweb.dev/).
- I spoke at [Aritfact Conference](https://artifactconf.com/) about the Lean Web. This was my first *real* conference talk, and Artifact kick-started my web dev career, so this felt like a full circle moment for me.
- I got to [chat with tons of awesome people as a guest on podcasts](/talks/#podcast-appearances) like JS Party and Script & Style.
- I quit JS Jabber and doubled down on my own [Vanilla JS Podcast](https://vanillajspodcast.com).
- I was interviewed for the [January 2020 issue of Net Magazine](https://www.myfavouritemagazines.co.uk/design/net-magazine-back-issues/net-january-2020-issue-327/) about the Lean Web. The issue was all about accessibility, so it felt like a great fit.
- With the exception of a few major holidays, I write a new article every single weekday. My newsletter started the year going to around 3,700 people. Today, about 7,800 read my newsletter each day. That's awesome growth!

## What didn't go so well in 2019

It wasn't *all* perfect. There are few things that, in retrospect, I wish had gone a bit differently.

<div class="list-spaced">

- Last year was an exceptionally busy one for me, and that meant I didn't have as much time to enjoy day-to-day life as I had in years past. Too many projects, too many new ventures, and too many things vying for my attention.
- I tried multiple times to launch a new "projects" product, first as a subscription service, then as a standalone course/guide thing. It just never stuck. How was it different from my pocket guides? From Academy? I never had a great answer for people. I ultimately ended up shutting it down.
- Our cat, Sasha, passed away just after the new year. She had been suffering from dementia and kidney disease, and her last year was pretty tough. I was never a cat guy, but her and my wife were a package deal, and she was an amazing cat that I'm going to miss terribly. I'm still hearing phantom meows at night and impulsively looking up to see if she's there.
- Also on the pet front, [my ~~client relations manager~~ dog Bailey](/about-bailey/) tore both her ACLs in one week. ACL surgery for dogs is human-level expensive, and it was a long, slow recovery process. Now she can run and jump and hop up on our bed like normal, but the summer was spent carrying her up and down stairs several times a day while she recovered.

## What I have planned for 2020

I've narrowed my product offerings to a very focused, small set of things: my newsletter, my pocket guides, and Academy.

This year, rather than trying to expand in a bunch of new directions, I want to make my current offerings even better. With that in mind, here are some things I'm considering for 2020...

<div class="list-spaced">
{{%md%}}
- Updating a few pocket guides to reflect changes in how I work with vanilla JS. The *API* guide needs to get updated with the Fetch API, for example. I'm also thinking about some new guides into some more advanced topics, like working with dates in JavaScript.
- Alumni of the redesigned Vanilla JS Academy have been *begging me* to put together an advanced version that dives into more complicated projects. I've got some ideas mapped out, and think this might have some traction.
- I've got an idea for a free project-based JavaScript course for beginners. Its less intense than Academy, a bit more hands on than the guides, and *way* more interesting than reading about techniques and theories like in a traditional course. I'll let you know more if that shakes out.

## What would you like to see from me in 2020?

Are there any topics you want me to write about? Products you want me to make? Anything I didn't mention that you'd like to see in 2020?

Let me know!
