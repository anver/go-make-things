One of the big trends that coronavirus/covid-19 has caused has been a shift to remote work for a lot of people. Some people love it, some people... really miss going into an office (I don't understand those people ðŸ˜‚).

Either way, businesses are slowly realizing that all of these jobs they thought absolutely had to happen in a physical location can, in fact, be done from anywhere. I think we're going to see more and more jobs that went remote during the pandemic stay remote when it's over (or at least, remote as an option if you want it).

But there's also a lot of companies that don't want to let go. I got an email from a Boston recruiter earlier this week about a React/Bootstrap developer (you can tell they really did their homework about me, huh?) that was remote right now, and would go back to partially in an office when this was over.

Um... [thank u, next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl1aHhXnN1k).

Anyways, this is all a long winded way of saying that I recently found [WFH, a hand-picked listing of remote jobs for web people](https://wfh.page/).

If you're looking for new work, or think you might be in the future, it might be worth signing up.

One quick tip: a lot of the *Development* jobs are database/OS-native/backend heavy, and many of the *Design* jobs are actually front-end dev roles. For example, I looked at three *UX/UI Designer* roles, and they were all actually what I would call front-end dev roles, looking for someone to build out HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Job titles are funny like that. Anyways, [check it out](https://wfh.page/)!
