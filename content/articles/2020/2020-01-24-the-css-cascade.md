<img alt="A screenshot of Amelia Wattenberger's amazing article on the CSS Cascade" src="/img/articles/css-cascade.jpg">

Amelia Wattenberger has put together what is, in my opinion, [the greatest article on the *cascade* (the C in CSS) ever written](https://wattenberger.com/blog/css-cascade).

> We style our websites using CSS, which stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**. But what does **Cascading** really mean?
>
> The CSS Cascade is one of the most powerful parts of CSS. But it can also be very frustrating, if not well understood. Anyone who’s worked on a large enough website has complained **"Why won’t this CSS property work?!"** And we’ve all been tempted to throw an `!important` to strong-arm things into place.
>
> To save ourselves from future angst, let’s take a step back and learn this thing for&nbsp;real.
