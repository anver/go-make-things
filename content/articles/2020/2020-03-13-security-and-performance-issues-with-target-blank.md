My friend Kieran Barker wrote a great article on [using `target="_blank"` on links, and why it's bad and you shouldn't do it](https://kbarker.dev/2020/02/24/security-and-performance-issues-with-target-blank-on-links).

Chris Coyier did a great job documenting [why you generally shouldn't use `target="_blank"`](https://css-tricks.com/use-target_blank/) a couple of years ago, but Kieran writes about a security issue I didn't know about.

> If a user clicks on one of your links which has `target="_blank"` set, the new page will have access to your pageâ€™s `window` object via the [`window.opener`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/opener) property. Does that sound like a bad thing? Because it is. The other page could redirect yours to a malicious URL.
