I recently had the pleasure of [chatting with Saron Yitbarek](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/what-is-vanilla-js-and-how-can-it-help-you), CEO of CodeNewbie, for the CodeNewbie Podcast.

We talked about vanilla JS and why it matters. We dug into issues like web performance, gatekeeping, and access to the web in times of crisis. We also pivoted a bit and talked about my journey from HR guy to web developer to JavaScript educator.

If you're struggling with imposter syndrome, you'll love this episode. It plagued me early in my career, and I spend a bit of time talking about how I got over it, and why you're almost certainly better than you think you are.
