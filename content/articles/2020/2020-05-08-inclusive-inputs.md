Oscar has put together [an amazingly in-depth guide on making forms more inclusive](https://www.ovl.design/text/inclusive-inputs/). He starts at the basics and works his way into some slightly more advanced stuff.

> At the end of February, 2019 WebAIM published an analysis of accessibility of the top one million websites. The results were depressing.
>
> The WebAIM 1 Million report found that:

> "59% of the 3.4 million form inputs identified were unlabeled (either via <label>, aria-label, or aria-labelledby). The presence of unlabeled form controls was a strong indicator of broader errorsâ€”pages with at least one missing form label averaged nearly 30 more errors than those without any label errors."

> Fifty-nine percent. That is a staggering number. Users that rely on Assistive Technology are not able to use more than half of the form inputs.

> We can do better. We have to do better.

There's also [a companion talk that goes along with it](https://talks.ovl.design/499kSM/edit-text-blank-inputs-accessibility), if that's more your thing.
