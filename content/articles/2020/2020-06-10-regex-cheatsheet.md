There's an old saying in computer science:

> If you use regex to solve a problem, now you have two problems.

A regex, or *Regular Expression*, is a way of matching patterns in a string. Earlier this year, I shared [a few videos from Steve Griffith on vanilla JS regex basics](/regex-with-javascript/).

Regex can be really difficult, but jokes aside, sometimes it honestly is the best way to solve a problem.

One of the toughest things about using regex is figuring out what patterns to actually use to do what you're trying to do.

Fortunately, the [amazing Emma Bostian](https://compiled.blog/) has you covered! **Emma's [regex cheatsheet](https://dev.to/emmawedekind/regex-cheat-sheet-2j2a)** includes tons of patterns for common tasks you might use regex for. It's a super handy resource.
