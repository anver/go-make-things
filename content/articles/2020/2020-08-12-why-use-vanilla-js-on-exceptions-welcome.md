Last week, I joined Ben Wilhelm and Collin Miller on [their new podcast, *Exceptions Welcome*, to chat vanilla JS](http://www.exceptionswelcome.com/1204355/4889057).

We spent a lot of time chatting about why I think vanilla JS is actually a *better* choice than larger libraries or frameworks in many cases. We also explored where newer micro-frameworks (like Preact and AlpineJS) and compilers like Svelte fit into the mix, and when using a full-fledged framework actually makes sense.

We also spent a fair bit of time chatting about the challenges of breaking into web development, how to find a job, and how to know what you should focus on when trying to learn.
