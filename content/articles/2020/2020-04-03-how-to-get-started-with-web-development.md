If you're new to web development (or you know someone who is), I wanted to share a few resources to help you (or them) get started.

This *isn't* intended to be a comprehensive list. This is a collection of my *"best recommendations"* so that you don't have to scour the web for hours doing your own research.

**A Primer**

- If you're completely knew and not sure where to start, I very much enjoy **[Don't Fear the Internet](http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com/)**, from Jessica Hische and Russ Maschmeyer. It's a bit dated, but still super useful and a very approachable primer.

**HTML & Layout**

- **[Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/)**, from my friends Heydon Pickering and Andy Bell, is a one-stop-shop for modern CSS layouts. They make this stuff *way* less painful than when I was learning.
- If you're more into video learning, **[Layout Land](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7TizprGknbDalbHplROtag)** from my friend Jen Simmons digs into modern approaches like Grid and Flexbox. Jen knows this stuff better than anyone!

**CSS**

- Once you get down some layout basics, the extraordinary Rachel Andrew's **[How to learn CSS](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/01/how-to-learn-css/)** is the most comprehensive and best written guide I've ever come across.
- If you learn better from videos, you also can't go wrong with the wonderful Steve Griffith's **[Learning CSS](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyuRouwmQCjl4wTSNbb8RTKZuyMhoIxBe)** YouTube series.

**JavaScript**

- When you're ready to dig into JavaScript (and honestly, this shouldn't happen until after you feel comfortable with HTML and CSS), my go-to resource for people are my **[Vanilla JS Pocket Guides](https://vanillajsguides.com)**.
- If you learn better from hacking away at things until you figure it out, you might also enjoy my **[Vanilla JS Toolkit](https://vanillajstoolkit.com/)**.

**Accessibility**

- Hands down the best resource for learning accessibility is **[the A11Y Project](https://a11yproject.com/)**, started by Dave Rupert and built with the generous help of many, many volunteers.
- For a short-and-sweet reference manual, I also very much enjoy Dave's **[A11Y Nutrition Cards](https://davatron5000.github.io/a11y-nutrition-cards/)**.

Happy learning!
