Today, I wanted to highlight a few new (to me) voices in tech that you might also enjoy.

- **[Tae'lur Alexis](https://dev.to/taeluralexis)** is an amazing developer who in the last few months started a [100 days of vanilla JS series](https://dev.to/taeluralexis), and started [live coding (mostly python) serveral days a week on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/cyberbarbie). She's [amusing as hell on Twitter](https://twitter.com/TaelurAlexis), too!
- **[Danny Thompson](https://twitter.com/DThompsonDev)** helps people start their careers in tech. He's a coach, motivator, and educator, and just an all around awesome dude. Check out [his podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3B3Fi99ldcrJBu2c3SZ0gM), [watch him live code](https://www.twitch.tv/dthompsondev), and [follow him on Twitter](https://twitter.com/DThompsonDev).
- **[Angie Jones](https://twitter.com/techgirl1908)** isn't *new to tech*, but she is newish to me. She's focused on Java (not Java*Script*), but she's still an amazing person you can learn a lot from. [Her website is full of great articles, talks, workshops, and courses.](https://angiejones.tech/) She runs a few courses on testing and automation that look particularly good. You can also [find her on Twitter](https://twitter.com/techgirl1908).

Enjoy!
