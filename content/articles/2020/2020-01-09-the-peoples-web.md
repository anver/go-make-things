Just before Christmas, Anil Dash published [The People's Web](https://anildash.com/2019/12/23/the-peoples-web/). In it, he wrote:

> Think of every time you've sent someone a <a href="https://www.snopes.com/">Snopes</a> link to debunk a spurious story that's been shared online. The casual way we might look up the credits for an album on <a href="https://www.discogs.com/">Discogs</a>, or for a movie on <a href="https://www.imdb.com/">IMDB</a>. The absurd details of popular culture captured on <a href="https://tvtropes.org/">TV Tropes</a> and <a href="https://www.fandom.com/">Fandom</a>, linguistic oddities documented on <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/">Urban Dictionary</a>, technical questions answered on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>, lyrics we quote from <a href="https://genius.com/">Genius</a>, memes on <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/">Know Your Meme</a> â€” all of these are a powerful and valuable record of the world around us, created and captured by millions of ordinary people. And there is, of course, <a href="https://wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> standing astride them all, as perhaps the pinnacle of people-created web references.

Some of the information on the sites is inaccurate, or skewed.

> But even with all their flaws, the existence of dozens of massive, collectively-maintained, curated and organized libraries of communal culture are still something like a miracle of the web. Tellingly, these kinds of sites rarely get launched these days, and the ones that have survived all follow a fairly common set of patterns. They often start as a labor of love from one person, or one small, tightly-knit community. The knowledge or information set that they record is considered obscure or even worthless to outsiders, until it becomes so comprehensive that its collective worth is undeniable...

> But here's the thing: **Taken together, these sites are as valuable as any of the giant platforms run by the tech titans.**

Anil then goes on to explore the vulnerability of these immensely value web platforms, and what we can do to help them.

> These people-made web communities are deeply vulnerable to the whims of the big players. We have to recognize their collective value before they're facing an existential threat.

It's a great article. [Go read the whole thing.](https://anildash.com/2019/12/23/the-peoples-web/)
