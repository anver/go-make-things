I recently had the pleasure of [chatting with Phil Burgess from the I.T. Career Energizer podcast about my career](https://itcareerenergizer.com/e249).

Phil and I talked about how I went from HR guy to self-taught web developer with lots of imposter syndrome to a vanilla JS expert. There's no secret shortcuts here, but there was definitely some luck and strategy.

The two most important takeaways from the show: network with as many people as possible, and teach what you know.
