I had the pleasure of being interviewed for [the January 2020 issue of Net Magazine](https://www.myfavouritemagazines.co.uk/design/net-magazine-back-issues/net-january-2020-issue-327/?force_sid=46acsact8tg7hdhimdfk0b7ln5), which, to my delight, was all about accessibility.

I had a great conversation about [the Lean Web](https://leanweb.dev), and how our modern best practices are doing more harm than good. My favorite quote from the whole interview got featured as a pull quote:

> The Lean Web is an approach to web development that focuses on simplicity, performance, and the user over the developer experience.

Copies are on newsstands in the US now, and possibly sold out in the UK already because they released the January issue in November or something.
