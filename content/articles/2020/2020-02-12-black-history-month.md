For Black History Month this year, I've decided to make my [Vanilla JS Guides Beginner's Bundle](https://vanillajsguides.com/beginner-bundle/) free for black people (and other people of color).

Use the code `BLACKHISTORY` at checkout.

*I should have launched this at the start of the month, but I didn't have my shit together. Sorry! If you're a person of color who already purchased the guides this month, let me know and I'll refund you.*

It hurts to think about how much more rich and vibrant the web community would be without 500 years of slavery and systemic oppression.

What I'm doing barely moves the needle, but I'm really passionate about helping people who are underrepresented in our community become a part of it, flourish, and thrive.

So, if you're interested, snag a free copy of my [Vanilla JS Guides Beginner's Bundle](https://vanillajsguides.com/beginner-bundle/) (to my white readers, sorry, this one's not for us).
