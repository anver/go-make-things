Last week, I had the pleasure of [chatting about the the Lean Web with Danny and Erik from the Web Platform Podcast](https://thewebplatformpodcast.com/196-lean-web-dev).

We talked about simplifying how we build for the web, why you should prioritize user experience over developer experience, and when and why you might actually want to reach for that framework.
