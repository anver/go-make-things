I love that J. Crew offers a mobile-optimized version of their emails. If you're going to take this approach, though, the link to view the mobile-optimized version should be big enough to actually click on a mobile phone.

My finger covers all three lines of text (and then some) at the top of this email. Clicking that link is no easy task!
