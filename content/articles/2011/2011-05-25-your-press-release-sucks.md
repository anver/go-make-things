title: Your Press Release Sucks
---

I get at least a couple of crappy press releases about stuff I don't care about a week. Just because I list my email address on this site doesn't mean you have my permission to spam me with irrelevant stuff.

Accordingly, I found this post from <a href="http://www.damniwish.com/2011/05/q-how-do-we-stop-a-blogger-from-writing-about-us.html">Andy Sernovitz at Damn, I Wish I Thought of That</a> particularly relevant...

<blockquote><strong>Q. How do we STOP a blogger from writing about us?</strong>

<strong>A. Send them a canned pitch from your PR firm.</strong>

These pitches are awful, off-topic, and off-putting. They also all look the same. Why would a blogger write a post being pushed by some junior PR rep? Every other blog is going to have the identical post.

These pitches are instant turn-offs to bloggers. We get them every day.  And we never write about these companies again.

When tracking the effectiveness of your blogger outreach campaigns, I know you track how many posts were written. But do you track how many bloggers you turned into enemies? (I bet your agency doesnâ€™t send you that stat.)</blockquote>
