The best way to learn JavaScript is by writing lots of code.

Reading articles and watching videos can be super helpful, but to really make everything "click" and stick in your mind, you need to put concepts into practice.

One of the things some people have told me they find difficult is coming up with projects to work on.

**I'm super excited to announce [Learn Vanilla JS](https://learnvanillajs.com/), a free vanilla JS learning roadmap.**

The site includes a roadmap of critical vanilla JS skills. Dig into a skill to get suggested learning resources and relevant project ideas. I've also included starter templates and instructions to help you get going more quickly.

After you've mastered a skill or completed a project, check if off and the site will save your learning progress for you.

If you have any questions or feedback, let me know!
