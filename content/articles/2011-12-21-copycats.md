<a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2011/11/27/copycats/">Matt Gemmell on innovation...</a>

<blockquote>The issue is that real design jobs aren’t about creating something absolutely new - instead, they’re about innovation. The etymology of the word ‘innovation’ means something like “renewing”, or changing an existing thing by adding something new or doing something differently. Not a clean-cut, start-from-scratch scenario - that’s not what innovation is, and that’s why it’s hard.</blockquote>

Innovation, invention, and great design are almost always about applying existing concepts in new ways. Making small changes. Looking at them through fresh eyes.

The iPhone is still a phone. The first car was, technically, still a carriage. It just lacked a horse. most of the parts used in a printing press or a lightbulb had already been invented. They just hadn't been combined into a unique, cohesive product.

What can you innovate today?
