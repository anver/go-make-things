Late last week, a Twitter thread from a venture capitalist on 10x engineers blew up.

It's gotten a lot of flack, and I don't want to encourage a pile on, so I'm not going to link to it. But, I do want to discuss some of the issues it raised because I think they're important.

If you've never heard the term before, a *10x engineer* is one who is hypothetically 10 times more productive than a typical developer.

The thread started off with this:

> 10x engineers
>
> Founders if you ever come across this rare breed of engineers, grab them. If you have a 10x engineer as part of your first few engineers, you increase the odds of your startup success significantly.

So... what's the problem here?

## How do you spot a 10x engineer?

The VC then asked:

> OK, here is a tough question. How do you spot a 10x engineer?

Then they launched into a bunch of stereotypes about what 10x engineers look like. It included ridiculous tropes like this.

> 1. 10x engineers hate meetings. They think it is a waste of time and obvious things are being discussed.

> 3. 10x engineers laptop screen background color is typically black (they always change defaults). Their keyboard keys such as i, f, x are usually worn out than of a, s, and e (email senders).

> 7. 10x engineers rarely look at help documentation of classes or methods. They know it in memory and can recall from memory. They write code at the same ease as writing English. No breaks, no pauce, just type.

> 8. 10x engineers are always learning new frameworks, languages ahead of everyone in the company. They are not afraid of anything new. If there is something new (e.g. blockchain) they gobble up, setup, experiment before anyone is getting started.

> 9. 10x engineers are poor mentors as they can't teach others on what to do OR parcel the work. They always think "It takes too long to teach or discuss with others, I would rather do it myself."

> 10. 10x engineers don't hack things. They write quality code and know exactly how the code has to evolve, and have a mental model of overall code structure. They write at most one design document, and the rest is in the code.

## Let's break this down

To recap: *10x engineers* are antisocial know-it-alls who never document their code and constantly want to work with "new and shiny" tech instead of "stable and proven" solutions.

Why is that a good thing, exactly?

The most productive engineer I've ever worked with a full-stack developer at a previous company. She wrote a lot of code, yes. But she also spent a *lot* of time educating both the rest of her team and other teams in adjacent parts of the company. Backend devs, front end devs, designers, UX pros.

She elevated the skill set of everyone around her through coaching and mentoring, focused on good documentation, and spent more time listening than talking.
