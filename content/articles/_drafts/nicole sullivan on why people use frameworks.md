# Show Notes

Hello, hello, hello. This is the Vanilla JavaScript Podcast. I'm Chris Ferdinandi. Thanks for joining me.

Today, I'm talking the benefit of JavaScript frameworks (crazy, right?).

## Key Points

Nicole Sullivan is an amazing developer. She invented OOCSS, upon which BEM, SMACSS, Atomic Design, Utility-Class First, and all of your other favorite CSS design systems are built on.

Last week she tweeted:

> vanilla js vs framework (yeah, I’m going there): y’all make good points on both sides but I see you missing one in particular.
>
> Frameworks like @reactjs provide patterns and conventions that are desperately needed so every decision doesn’t start from, wheee! We could do anything! They lower cognitive overhead.

And she's 100% right. That's the biggest hurdle to not just JS, but any language.

PHP has this problem, and WordPress's well-documented standards and conventions make it easier to get going and work consistently.

CSS has this problem. That's in part why Bootstrap and Foundation are so popular. They provide much needed structure to an endless. Nicole goes on to say,

> Sure, you could write all your own conventions, and document them (have there ever been truly good internal docs?), and teach them to all new devs who won’t have any context. But, you’d probably have written something as big as a framework at that point.

And this is where I humbly disagree with her. The two options here are not "use a JavaScript framework" or "write something bespoke", just like the two options in CSS aren't "use a CSS framework" or "write something bespoke."

This is why OOCSS (and BEM, and Atomic Design, and so on) are also so popular. They provide a much needed structure to our CSS. There's no one approach used on every project, but there are a set of conventions you can apply to a project to enforce that consistency.

We have some semblances of that in JavaScript (functional programming, for example, or OO Programming), but nothing quite as well structured or specific as what's available for CSS.

And maybe that's what we really need more than another over-engineered framework.
