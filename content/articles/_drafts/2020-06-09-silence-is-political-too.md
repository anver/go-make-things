In response to yesterday's article on how [all tech is political](/all-tech-is-political/), I had a few folks argue that business (and by extension, technology) are inherently apolitical (without politics).

Nonsense!

Technology is always shaped by the people who create and use it. Businesses are an imaginary construct that only exist because people come together to work on something. Business is people.

Also, who says businesses by definition are apolitical? That's just silly.

There are plenty of companies who are politically active, either because their leaders feel a strong sense of moral obligation (DDH from Basecamp, and their positions on privacy that's reflected in all of the things they make), or because company leaders see a marketing benefit from associating with a social movement.

Even when it's not obvious or publicly stated, most major corporations donate to political campaigns that they feel will benefit them financially.

**But silence is also political.**

Not saying anything doesn't make you apolitical. It doesn't mean you're not supporting either side. By not speaking out against oppression, you've chosen the side of the oppressor. Silence is political.

I've seen a few prominent experts in the last week or two remain completely silent, or worse, dismissively say, "you don't follow me for my views on politics."

My dude, you have a giant audience. Use that influence for good. If you don't, you've already picked side.
