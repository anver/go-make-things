I often see people trying to use JavaScript to "fix" things they don't like about the web. It's how we end up with Single Page Apps, large frameworks, CSS-in-JS, complicated module loaders, and so on.

To me, these are solutions to problems so much as rejections of the fundamental nature of the web.

When I was in high school, I was introduced to Taoism through [*The Tao of Pooh* and *The Te of Piglet*](https://www.amazon.com/Tao-Pooh-Te-Piglet/dp/014095144X).

In those books, the author wrote about the willows and the oak tree. In a storm, the unbending tree falls over, while the willow bends with the wind and remains standing the next day.

He wrote of water in a flowing river. Rather than coming up with clever ways to remove rocks from its path, it flows gently around them, slowly carving away at them over time.

So

No, I’m not familiar with Taoism at all.

But you make sense…the analogy works like a charm…

Trying to fight against it with JS solutions leads to fragile solutions more likely to “fail in the storm,” while embracing the nature of the medium will result in both a happier dev experience and more resilient apps and sites
