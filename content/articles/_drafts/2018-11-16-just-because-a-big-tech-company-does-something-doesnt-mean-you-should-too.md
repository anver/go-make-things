In fact, it may well mean the opposite.

I've been talking a lot about [my issues with CSS-in-JS](/overengineering-css/) lately. One of the biggest counter-arguments I get in favor of it is something like this:

> Twitter has had great success using CSS-in-JS with their large engineering organization.

Have they, though?

## Large organizations don't optimize for user experience.

They optimize for cost. They optimize for internal ease (same thing, I suppose). And they optimize to maintain internal power.

If Twitter optimized for user experience, we would still have a reverse-chronological feed of just the stuff the people you follow post. We'd have a fully-functioning API and thriving third-party app market. We wouldn't have Nazis.

When's the last time you've loved a change Twitter has made to their site? So why would you idolize their engineering process?

Yes, Twitter reduced the size of their overall CSS using CSS-in-JS. But they could have done that other, less fragile and user-hostile ways, too.

## Making things complex is easy. Making them simple is hard.

Twitter and tons of other big tech companies are filled with lots of super talented people. I certainly don't want to take away from their hard work.

CSS-in-JS can be an incredibly impressive piece of engineering.

I'm sure it helps Twitter's internal teams work around lots of application-level and organizational complexity.

That doesn't mean it's good for the web, or that you should use it, too.
