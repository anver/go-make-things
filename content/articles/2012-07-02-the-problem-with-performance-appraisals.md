title: The problem with performance appraisals

My dad sent me a <a href="http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2012/06/27/are-annual-performance-reviews-necessary/">Forbes article</a> claiming that 98 percent of HR executives say that annual performance appraisals aren't useful.

A number like that immediately makes me very skeptical of the article. That's a bold claim, and a majority of HR professionals I meet think performance appraisals are useful and a good use of time.

I, however, don't.

The problem with them is actually pretty simple: If your organization has managers who properly manage performance throughout the year, appraisals are superfluous and time consuming. If you don't, they're of no value.
