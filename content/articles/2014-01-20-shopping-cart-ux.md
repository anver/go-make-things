You probably don't think about shopping carts as having a user interface, but they do. Target has done something pretty neat to improve the UI, and by extension, the UX, of their shopping carts.

They made the entire top rail a handle.

What's a small change you can make to one of your projects that makes life a little bit easier for your users?
