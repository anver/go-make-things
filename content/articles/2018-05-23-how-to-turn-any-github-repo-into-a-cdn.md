Last week I discovered [jsDeliver](https://www.jsdelivr.com/), a service that let's you turn any GitHub repository into a CDN.

(*Hat tip to [Sarah Dayan, aka Frontstuff](https://frontstuff.io/), for this one.*)

Here's how it works.

1. The base URL is `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/{username}/{repo}/`, where you replace `{username}` with the GitHub username and `{repo}` with the repository name for the project.
2. Append that URL with the path to the file you want to access in the project. For example, for my [Atomic XHR plugin](https://github.com/cferdinandi/atomic), the JavaScript file is located in the `/dist` directory. You'd use this.
	```html
	<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cferdinandi/atomic/dist/atomic.js"></script>
	```

You can also take advantage of semantic versioning by adding `@{version-number}` to the repository name. You can target major, minor, and patch releases as desired.

```html
<!-- Always get the latest version -->
<!-- Not recommended for production sites! -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cferdinandi/atomic/dist/atomic.js"></script>

<!-- Get minor updates and patch fixes within a major version -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cferdinandi/atomic@4/dist/atomic.js"></script>

<!-- Get patch fixes within a minor version -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cferdinandi/atomic@4.0/dist/atomic.js"></script>

<!-- Get a specific version -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cferdinandi/atomic@4.0.0/dist/atomic.js"></script>
```

I've already added instructions on this to [Atomic](https://github.com/cferdinandi/atomic), [Validate](https://github.com/cferdinandi/validate), and [Smooth Scroll](https://github.com/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll), and will be updating the docs for [my other plugins](https://vanillajstoolkit.com/plugins) as well.

But where this really shines is for use with other peoples' OSS projects when a CDN isn't provided by you need a quick and easy way to load the code into your site.

jsDelivr also supports NPM and WordPress.
