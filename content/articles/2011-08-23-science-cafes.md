<blockquote><a href="http://www.sciencecafes.org/">Science cafés</a> are live events that involve a face-to-face conversation with a scientist about current science topics. They are open to everyone, and take place in casual settings like pubs and coffeehouses.

Anyone can go to a science café, and anyone can start an event series of their own. Use this site to find out more.</blockquote>
