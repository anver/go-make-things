title: Building websites that work on an e-ink kindle&#8230; revisited

A couple of weeks ago, I wrote [Building websites that work on an e-ink Kindle](/building-websites-that-work-on-an-e-ink-kindle/). It was a response to Brad Frost's post on [providing accessible web experiences on low-powered devices](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/accessibility-and-low-powered-devices/).

I discovered a few things:

1. My Kindle completely ignored CSS and JavaScript.
2. My Kindle ignored anchor links.
3. SVGs and web fonts aren't supported (no surprise).
4. PNGs and JPGs worked just fine.

A few folks in the comments did some tests of their own, and found that e-ink Kindle support for CSS, JS and more is actually quite good. My Kindle is just absurdly old. Some worthwhile articles that were shared by other readers:

* [Voyage vs Paperwhite Comparison Review: the Web Browser](http://the-digital-reader.com/2014/10/22/voyage-vs-paperwhite-comparison-review-web-browser/)
* [Intégrateur de l’extrême : naviguer sur Kindle](http://www.nicolas-hoffmann.net/source/1637-Integrateur-de-l-extreme-naviguer-sur-Kindle.html) (in French, but the pictures are informative)
