The news is full of terrible stories. That's what gets viewers, even though there's a ton of good in the world that never gets air time.

Start 2015 off a bit happier. Check out [this post about awesome, wonderful things](http://inspirational.diply.com/trendyjoe/16-heartwarming-examples-proving-there-is-good-in-world/64525/1), and if you want more, [check out this Christmas-themed one, too](http://inspirational.diply.com/different-solutions/christmas-stories-faith-in-humanity/66911/1).

I would honestly pay for a daily or weekly publication that ran nothing but stories like this.
