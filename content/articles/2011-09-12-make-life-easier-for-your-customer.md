A few weeks ago, Hurricane Irene beat up the Northeast coast of the US pretty bad. Some areas of New England were without power for over a week.

Hardware stores saw a run on generators. Lowe's made it easy.

When you walked into the store, they had a row of flatbed carriages pre-loaded with a generator, connector cable and gas canister. Grab-and-go shopping. What a great way to make life easier for your customers!
