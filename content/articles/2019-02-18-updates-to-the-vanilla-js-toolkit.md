Over the last month or two, I've made a handful of updates to the [Vanilla JS Toolkit](https://vanillajstoolkit.com) to make it an even better resource.

Some highlights:

- Every method and helper function includes browser compatibility info.
- All of the polyfills include info about how far back they push browser support.
- All of the helper functions now include CodePen demos. I'll be adding them to the native methods and APIs soon, too.
- The Reference section (which documents the browser-native stuff) got a complete overhaul to make it easier to use.
