title: What&#8217;s the Ideal Length for Web Video?
---

One of my mantras around web video recently has been that people are more likely to watch three 2-minute videos than sit through one 6-minute video.

One of my favorite things about <a href="http://www.30secondmba.com/">Fast Company's 30-Second MBA series</a> is that the videos are less than a minute long. If they were four or five minutes long, I'm not sure I'd watch them.

And as I think about some of the worst web videos and webinars I've sat through, they were always too long.

<h2>Is Shorter Really Better?</h2>

That said, there have been a few occasions where I've happily watched videos that are much longer than that than this mythical one to two minute mark.

Episodes of the <a href="http://vimeo.com/putthison">Put This On web series</a> are around eight to 12 minutes in length, and I'm always disappointed when they end. <a href="http://www.ted.com/">TED Talks</a> are anywhere from 15 to 20 minutes in length. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ2vtQCESpk">Garr Reynolds' Presentation Zen</a> is an hour well spent, as is <a href="http://inboxzero.com/video/">Merlin Mann's Inbox Zero</a>.

<h2>So what's the magic number? Is there one?</h2>

As I get more involved in <a href="https://gomakethings.com/portfolio/career-tv/">video work at EMC</a>, this is an important question. Some videos are hits. Some are duds. And there doesn't seem to be a strong correlation or trend that I've been able to identify yet.

I wonder how factors like content, context and length converge to capture or lose people's attention.

If I'm deeply engrossed in the material, I don't <em>want</em> the video to end. I want more. But I'd imagine I would at some point also over saturate myself. I ravenously consumed all of Garr's blog posts on Presentation Zen for about a year. Then I got tired of it and just stopped.

Any insights you can share?
