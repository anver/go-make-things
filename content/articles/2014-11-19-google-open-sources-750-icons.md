Google has open-sourced a[ 750-icon set of icons](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/releases/tag/1.0.0).

The set contains some pretty useful icons, and contains SVG versions of all of the icons. That means you can use them with your [SVG build system](https://github.com/cferdinandi/gulp-boilerplate) or as part of an icon font set with [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/).

[Check them out on GitHub.](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/releases/tag/1.0.0)
