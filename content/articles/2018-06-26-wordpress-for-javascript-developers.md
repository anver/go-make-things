This Friday (June 26, 2018), I'll be giving a free, virtual talk on moving beyond WordPress as a CMS as part of [Zac Gordon's  JavaScript for WordPress Conference](https://javascriptforwp.com/conference/).

WordPress was my entry into web development, and I used it for almost a decade.

Over the last few years, I've shifted from WordPress to [static websites powered by Hugo](/static-websites/), with JavaScript for dynamic content and interaction. But WordPress still plays an important role for me.

I'm not a backend developer, and WordPress provides an amazing toolset I use as a JS developer with my static websites.

In this talk, I explore how WordPress can be the backend engine for your JavaScript apps, an API service, and so much more. I don't use WordPress as CMS anymore, but it's still an invaluable part of my toolkit.
