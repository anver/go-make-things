ECMAScript (ES for short) is the name for the standardized versions of JavaScript.

[Kangax](https://github.com/kangax) has put together a really handy [table detailing features of different version of ES](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/), and which browsers and runtime environments they're supported in.

I wouldn't necessarily use this as my first go-to, but I can see this being pretty handy in a lot of situations.
