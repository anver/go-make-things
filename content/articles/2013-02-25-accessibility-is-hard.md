Responsive design? Check. WordPress? I'm on it. Accessibility? Ummm...

Web accessibility is hard. Information is hard to find. It's often out-of-date. When you do find useful information, it's usually presented in a way that's difficult to understand or implement.

But it's also insanely important. Accessibility is part of the web's core DNA. Universal access.

Dave Rupert and a handful of other awesome people have created <a href="http://a11yproject.com/">the Accessibility Project</a>, a community-driven effort to make web accessibility easier.

This is an insanely awesome resource for web developers. It's written in plain English. Articles are short and action-oriented. The people are awesome.

Seriously, grab the feed or bookmark the site. Do it!
