title: 3 new Kraken add-ons
---

Last week I released three new add-ons for <a href="http://cferdinandi.github.io/kraken/">Kraken</a>. All three are WordPress plugins. They're also all forked and remixed from other great projects.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://cferdinandi.github.io/html-minify/">HTML Minify</a> minifies the markup WordPress outputs for your site, reducing file size and improving performance.</li>
<li><a href="http://cferdinandi.github.io/image-compress-and-sharpen/">Image Compress &amp; Sharpen</a> changes the default WordPress compression rate for JPGs, and also provides an option to sharpen images.</li>
<li><a href="http://cferdinandi.github.io/google-hosted-jquery/">Google-Hosted jQuery</a> uses the Google CDN version of jQuery, with the version built into WordPress as a fallback.</li>
</ul>

Enjoy!
