[Brutalist Web Design](https://brutalist-web.design/) is a set of web design and development principles from [David Copeland](https://twitter.com/davetron5000) that I'm 100% down with.

> - Content is readable on all reasonable screens and devices.
> - Only hyperlinks and buttons respond to clicks.
> - Hyperlinks are underlined and buttons look like buttons.
> - The back button works as expected.
> - View content by scrolling.
> - Decoration when needed and no unrelated content.
> - Performance is a feature.

Each core tenant has a brief article expanding on it.

For example, here's David's comments on "view content by scrolling:"

> A website is not a book or a magazine. Because it's viewed in a browser, users can scroll the browser's viewport to read content that can't fit on one screen. This mechanism works beautifully and allows visitors to read content uninterrupted by clicking and page-reloading.
>
> While long-form content may require navigation and multiple pages, there's rarely need to artificially paginate articles, blog posts, or other medium-length content simply to satisfy advertisers or inflate engagement numbers.
