Earlier this week I discovered [Offside.js](https://github.com/toomuchdesign/offside), and awesome vanilla JS off-canvas navigation plugin from [Andrea Carraro](http://www.andreacarraro.it/).

A few things I love about Offside.js:

- **Proper documentation!** This is so uncommonly rare in open source projects.
- **Multiple ways to install it.** NPM, ES6 imports, old-school `script` and `link` elements. Awesomesauce!
- **Customizable with options.** This is such a nice detail that makes a plugin extensible for tons of use cases and projects without needing to touch the core code. Love it!
- **Public methods.** These let you do all sorts of cool things, like trigger off-canvas behaviors from other scripts and user interactions.
- **Great browser support.** It works in all modern browsers, and IE9+, with clear documentation of the JS methods it uses.
- **Semantic versioning.** Makes it easier to keep track of how things change over time.

I love this plugin. Great work, Andrea!
