I hadn't really thought about the connection between the words we use as developers and their connotations.

The *master/slave* one is obvious and terrible when take even a second to think about it, and I'm embarrassed I didn't make this connection sooner. I love *primary/replica*, and I think it actually explains the relationship better.

Some people were quick to point out to André that *blacklist* has origins that predate the racial tensions and history of slavery in the US, but I'm not sure that matters all that much.

Those tensions and deep scars exist, and calling "the bad things" *black* and "the good things" *white* has racial undertones, whether that was the origin or not.

I'm committing to using new phrases for things like this. I hope you will, too.
