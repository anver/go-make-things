> I bet “imposter syndrome” is extra strong in music. Like feeling you are barely competent at playing this instrument surrounded by people who actually know how music works.

My grandfather is a musician.

He's been playing piano for 92 years. He doesn't consider himself a "real musician."

He taught himself how when he was six years old. I would imagine he wasn't very good at first, but he's amazing now.

He plays entirely by ear. He can listen to a song once or twice, and then go off and play a jazz improvised version of it along with the track (or the band, if live). He can play over a dozen instruments.

And his *imposter syndrome* is on full fire when he sits down next to trained musicians, because he can't sight read music and they can.

That sounds absurd, doesn't it?

Because, he's obviously a real musician. How do I know? Because he plays music.

Just like you're a *real developer* because you write code.

It doesn't matter if you have a Computer Science degree or are self-taught. It doesn't matter if you're a senior developer or a beginner who's just starting out. It doesn't even matter if you're paid to do it or still a student.

If you write code, you're a developer. Just like my badass grandfather is a real musician.
