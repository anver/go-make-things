Yesterday, we looked at [how to test if every item in an array meets some criteria](/how-to-check-if-every-item-in-an-array-matches-some-criteria-with-vanilla-javascript/). Today, I want to show you how to check if at least one item in the array is a match.

## Using the `Array.some()` method

The `Array.some()` method tests whether or not at least one item in an array meets a specific criteria. You pass in a callback function that should return a comparison to evaluate.

The callback accepts three arguments: the current item in the loop's value, its index, and the array itself. Typically, though, you only really need to pass in the item.

For example, letâ€™s check if at least one item in an array of integers is greater than 10.

```js
// Returns true
[12, 25, 42, 99, 101].some(function (item) {
	return item > 10;
});

// Returns true
[1, 12, 25, 42, 99, 101].some(function (item) {
	return item > 10;
});

// Returns false
[1, 1, 3, 7, 9, 10].some(function (item) {
	return item > 10;
});
```

Just like `Array.every()`, this is pretty useful, and nicer than running a `for` or `forEach()` loop.

## Browser Compatibility

The `Array.some()` method works in all modern browsers, and IE9 and up. You can [push support back to IE6 with a polyfill](https://vanillajstoolkit.com/polyfills/arraysome/).
