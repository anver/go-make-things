The delightful Dave Rupert just launched [nutrition cards for accessible web components](https://davatron5000.github.io/a11y-nutrition-cards/).

This project provides simple overviews of the behavior expectations around focus, labels, and keyboard use for common web components like accordions, buttons, and tabs. This is a fantastic resource Dave's built, and I can't wait to see it grow!
