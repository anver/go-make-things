I took often about [how important it is for JavaScript developers to know CSS](/css-isnt-broken-your-developers-just-suck-at-it/).

A few readers asked me if I had any recommended resources for learning CSS. I turned around and asked a few CSS experts I know, as well as people on Twitter.

Here are the top recommended resources they shared for learning CSS:

- [The Layout Land Series](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7TizprGknbDalbHplROtag) by [Jen Simmons](http://jensimmons.com/)
