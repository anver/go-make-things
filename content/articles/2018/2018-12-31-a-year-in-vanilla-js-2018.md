In the middle of 2017, I decided to switch from my more generalist web development writing (a little of this, a little of that) to focusing on just vanilla JS.

I had looked at my site analytics and noticed that eight of the top ten most read articles on my site where all about how to do jQuery stuff without jQuery, and realized there was a real need for more content like that.

And so, 2018 marked my first full year focused on vanilla JS. Some highlights:

- I started the year with around 800 email subscribers, and ended the year with over 3,200.
- My product sales doubled from last year.
- I created video course versions of my [vanilla JS pocket guides](https://vanillajsguides.com).
- I launched a new training program: the [Vanilla JS Academy](https://vanillajsacademy.com).
- The legendary Jeremy Keith featured a few articles of mine [on his site](https://adactio.com/links/).
- Chris Coyier called me [one of the "web dev blogging MVPs" of 2018](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier/status/1072514714004045824).
- I joined the prolific [JS Jabber podcast](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/) as a cohost.
- My article on [what makes someone a good web developer](https://gomakethings.com/what-makes-someone-a-good-front-end-developer/) has become one of the most shared articles in my sites history.

Here's to hoping 2019 can compete.

Happy New Year!
