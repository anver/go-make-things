_**UPDATE:** I now recommend [using `fetch()` over XHR](/how-to-use-the-fetch-api-with-vanilla-js/)._

> AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. In a nutshell, it is the use of the XMLHttpRequest object to communicate with servers. It can send and receive information in various formats, including JSON, XML, HTML, and text files. AJAXâ€™s most appealing characteristic is its "asynchronous" nature, which means it can communicate with the server, exchange data, and update the page without having to refresh the page. <cite>[Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX/Getting_Started)</cite>

AJAX is the primary method you use to get and send data to APIs in JavaScript.

Making AJAX requests with the `XMLHttpRequest()` method, often referred to as XHR, is a three step process:

1. Set up our request by creating a new `XMLHttpRequest()`.
2. Create an `onload` callback to run when the request completes.
3. Open and send our request.

## An Example

Let's put together an example that requests data from [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), a site that provides real API endpoints and sends back placeholder content.

First, let's set up a new XHR request.

```js
// Set up our HTTP request
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
```

Next, let's create an `onload` event that will run when our request completes and data is sent back.

The XHR request will return with a `status` property that contains [an HTTP status code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status). Codes from `200` to `299` are consider a success. Anything else is not.

We can check that our request was successful by making sure the `xhr.status` was greater than or equal to `200` *and* less than `300`.

```js
// Set up our HTTP request
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

// Setup our listener to process completed requests
xhr.onload = function () {

	// Process our return data
	if (xhr.status >= 200 && xhr.status < 300) {
		// This will run when the request is successful
		console.log('success!', xhr);
	} else {
		// This will run when it's not
		console.log('The request failed!');
	}

	// This will run either way
	// All three of these are optional, depending on what you're trying to do
	console.log('This always runs...');
};
```

Finally, we'll open our request, specifying the request type (more on that in the next lesson), and the URL to make our request to.

Then, we'll send our request.

```js
// Set up our HTTP request
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

// Setup our listener to process completed requests
xhr.onload = function () {

	// Process our return data
	if (xhr.status >= 200 && xhr.status < 300) {
		// What do when the request is successful
		console.log('success!', xhr);
	} else {
		// What do when the request fails
		console.log('The request failed!');
	}

	// Code that should run regardless of the request status
	console.log('This always runs...');
};

// Create and send a GET request
// The first argument is the post type (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
// The second argument is the endpoint URL
xhr.open('GET', 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
xhr.send();
```

Give this a try yourself!

Copy and paste the code above into the console tab in your browsers developer tools and see what comes back.

## Browser Compatibility

XHR works in all modern browsers, and IE7 and above.
