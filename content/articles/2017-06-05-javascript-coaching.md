The thing that helped me the most when I was learning JavaScript was having someone to bounce ideas of, give me feedback on my code, and help point me in the right direction when I got stuck.

I'm excited to launch a new [JavaScript coaching program](/coaching/). Youâ€™ll have direct access to me through:

1. Group video chats, either weekly or every other week, depending on your program.
2. Private video calls, either weekly or monthly (not available with all programs).
3. My exclusive Slack channel, where you can message me privately or chat with other students.

Whether you're a complete beginner or  you're looking to become more advanced, this is a great way to accelerate your learning.
