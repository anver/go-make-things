I'll admit, in 2012 I was very focused on the minutia of design. As I detailed in <a href="https://gomakethings.com/stuff-i-learned-this-year/">"Stuff I Learned This Year,"</a> last year I threw myself into responsive and mobile-first web design. I learned how to do a lot of awesome stuff.

But I also find the minutia tiring if it's all I focus on day-in and day-out. At the end of a day of coding, I find myself bleary-eyed and mentally exhausted. I love it, but I also like the broader stuff, too.

I wish there was a better title for "Person Who Makes Things for the Web." Because web designer/developer speaks to the creation of websites, but I'm passionate about so much more than that - videos, podcasts, ebooks, and so on.

That's what I hope to do more of this year.
