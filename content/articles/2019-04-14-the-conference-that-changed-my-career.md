Six years ago, I was just starting my career as a web developer. I had been working as an HR pro for a few years, and was trying to break into a new field as a self-taught developer.

I somehow convinced my manager at the time to pay for me to attend a brand new conference being run in driving distance from me in Providence, RI: [Artifact](https://artifactconf.com/).

It was an amazing experience for me. I got to see and meet people who I had been learning so much from talk in person, like [Dave Rupert](https://daverupert.com/), [Jen Simmons](http://jensimmons.com/), [Ethan Marcotte](https://ethanmarcotte.com/), and [Brad Frost](http://bradfrost.com/). I made some new friends, like [Chris Buecheler](https://closebrace.com/) and [Divya Sasidharan](http://shortdiv.com/).

I also met someone who several months later helped me get my first real web developer role. I had been job hunting for almost two years.

**Artifact literally changed my career.**

Cofounded by [Jennifer Robbins](https://www.learningwebdesign.com/), [Arianne Stiles](https://twitter.com/ari4nne), and [Christopher Schmitt](https://twitter.com/teleject), Artifact ran for just two years.

It was an affordable, small, single-track conference with a wonderfully intimate vibe. You could have a back-channel conversation on Twitter and then see those people in walking around a short while later. That's actually how Chris Buecheler and I met.

It's the gold standard I hold all other conferences to. None have ever been as good, as I was heartbroken when Jennifer told me they wouldn't be running another one.

**But the story doesn't end there...**

Five years later, Jennifer, Arianne, and Christopher are bring Artifact back&mdash;and I'm beyond excited to announce that I'll be speaking there!

I'll be talking about the [Lean Web](https://gomakethings.com/the-lean-web-video-from-boston-css/) alongside [industry legends](https://artifactconf.com/speakers/) like Brad Frost, Sarah Drasner, Chris Coyier, Jen Simmons and more. And in what feels like a full circle moment, my friend Divya is also speaking. She was also just starting her career when we met, and I'm beyond excited to be sharing a stage with her.

The two-day conference is happening on September 30 and October 1 in Austin, TX. There are a small number of early bird tickets on sale right now.
