I offer two JavaScript learning products: my [Pocket Guides](https://vanillajsguides.com) and the [Vanilla JS Academy](https://vanillajsacademy.com).

The topics covered in the two are similar, and people sometimes ask me why I offer two different (and seemingly competing) learning products.

Not everyone learns the same way, and the same person may learn best using different approaches at different points in their learning process. My different learning products try to take this into account.

While the Guides and Academy cover similar subject matter, their approaches to learning are completely different.

## So... how are they different?

The Pocket Guides try to cover all of the important details on a particular topic, then walk you through a project to help you remember what you learned.

They're short and narrowly focused on a single topic. Their goal is to give you just enough to get started, and serve as a handy reference guide on a specific topic.

The Vanilla JS Academy is about learning by doing, and puts a focus on solving cross-functional problems rather than specific topics.

The program gives you just enough information to get started on projects without giving you all the answers. It involves a bigger time commitment, and tries make learning and problem-solving a daily habit that eventually becomes second nature.

If you learn best from experience and building things, Academy is a great fit. If you learn best by being guided through a problem, Academy would probably be a waste of money. The Guides would be a better use of your time and money.
