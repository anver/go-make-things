One of the most common questions I get about the [Vanilla JS Academy](https://vanillajsacademy.com) is how it's different from my [pocket guides](https://vanillajsguides.com).

The guides try to cover all of the important details on a particular topic, then walk you through a project to help you remember what you learned. I literally take you step-by-step through applying all of the stuff you just learned to a specific problem.

**Academy is about learning from doing**, and gives you *just enough information* to get started on projects without giving you all the answers.

You'll struggle a bit, and that's the point. The learning moments come from figuring out to think through problems you haven't experienced before.

If you learn best from experience and building things, Academy is a great fit. If you learn best by being guided through a problem, Academy would probably be a waste of money.

Neither way is "right" or "best." They're just different.

                After going through this program, I found that using vanilla JS, you can accomplish A LOT more than the larger dev community would lead you to believe.<br><br>I really liked the open-endedness of the weekly projects. I think having fewer restraints in solving the task made me focus more on the specific topic for that week and how I would apply it to the given project. Combining this with the Thursday office hour and then having your approach shared on Friday made for a well-rounded overview of the material.<br><br>Thanks for an awesome course, Chris! This truly was the best JS learning experience I’ve had—things really clicked for me during the academy and I feel much more comfortable using JavaScript and approaching problems with JS-specific solutions at the ready!<cite>- <a href="https://www.zac-heisey.com">Zac Heisey</a></cite></blockquote>

                I was not sure the level of the course. I was not looking for a 101 of JS, which the course was not. It was exactly what I was after.<br><br>I really benefited from and liked both the office hours (including code reviews) and the interaction with Chris and students on Slack (a big thing many other course do not have). It was also nice to see how other students approached the same problem.
