Yesterday, I wrote about how [I offer location-based pricing for all of my products](/location-based-pricing/).

Someone living in Kenya, where the average annual web developer salary is $3,942 USD, pays a substantially lower price for my [guides, courses](https://vanillajsguides.com), and [training program](https://vanillajsacademy.com) then someone living in the United States does. It's the same amount as a percentage of their annual income, but lower in absolute terms.

The most common follow-up question I got to the articles was:

> Can't someone just use a VPN based in a different location to get the discount and rip you off?

Yes. Yes, they can.

> What are you doing to stop that from happening?

Honestly, nothing.

Two years ago, I rolled out discounts on my products [for students](/student-discount/) and [for people who are part of under-represented groups in technology](/underrepresented-group-discount/).

When I did, I decided that rather than build in some sort of system that requires people to prove to me they're a student or a member of an under-represented group, it was both easier for me and better for my customers if I operated from a place of trust.

I display this message with both of the programs:

> _**Note:** I’m using an honor system for this. I don’t verify that you’re actually {{a student | a member of an under-represented group in tech}}, because I trust that you’ll do the right thing._

I believe that people are generally good, and will do the right thing.

I find that when you treat people with trust, the way they behave and interact with you is inherently different than if you assume they might do something wrong.

[Andy Bell shared similar thoughts](https://hankchizljaw.com/wrote/every-layout-how-it-works/) around his and Heydon's [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/) toolkit:

> We believe that most people are fundamentally honest, so we’d rather not punish them for what might happen, because of a couple of bad actors.

This isn't something that just a small, scrappy business-of-one can get away with, either. Apple runs a robust student discount program and doesn't verify that you're a student before checkout.

The benefits of running a business based on trust are huge.

My customers and I have a deeper relationship. It feels more like an internet friendship or mentoring relationship than a business/customer transaction. People appreciate that I treat them like, well, people.

I can't imagine running a business any other way.
