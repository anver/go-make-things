I often get asked if I have any recommended resources for learning CSS.

Just around this time last year, I asked my readers for suggestions. Then, I rounded them up and [published them in an article](/learning-css/).

But if you were to ask me that same question today, I would immediately point you to [Steve Griffith's Learning CSS series on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyuRouwmQCjl4wTSNbb8RTKZuyMhoIxBe).

I love Steve's videos for a few reasons. They have a really nice progression from the basics (how to load styles into a page, basic syntax) to intermediate topics (CSS layout) into advanced stuff (animations, pseudo properties). Steve takes his time explaining topics in a way that's really approachable for people who are just learning.

And honestly, a big part of the appeal is how calming and soothing his voice is. I told Steve that I think he's the Bob Ross of coding, and apparently I'm not the first person who's said that.

I learned CSS before I learned JavaScript. I've been using it a long time. I still learned some things from Steve's videos.

If CSS is something you've been wanting to learn, [go check out the playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyuRouwmQCjl4wTSNbb8RTKZuyMhoIxBe).
