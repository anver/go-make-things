I have a deep appreciation for good design. But I absolutely suck at things like color theory and typography.

**And that's why I absolutely *love* tools like [Colors](http://clrs.cc/).**

Colors is a tiny color palette designed for use in prototyping apps and websites. Honestly, though, I think it's also a great place to grab a few colors that work well together for any small project.

Colors is a modern take on some of the old standard named colors.

Instead of the garish defaults, you use named classes to show a more subtle, harmonious collection of colors. Instead of named color values like `blue`, `orange`, `yellow`, `red`, and `green`, you use classes like `.bg-blue` or `.border-blue`.
