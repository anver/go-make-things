Reader [Hilton Meyer](https://hiltonmeyer.com/) tipped me off to [jsonbox.io](https://jsonbox.io), a free HTTP based JSON storage utility.

If you're working on a prototype or a side-project and need a quick way to store JSON data between sessions, this is a super handy little utility.

Storage limits are a small, and this is a free service, so it's definitely not for production projects. It's a great way to get something stood up quickly, though.

Check it out at [jsonbox.io](https://jsonbox.io).
