Yesterday, I quietly launched a dedicated website for my thoughts on the lean web: [LeanWeb.dev](https://leanweb.dev).

In addition to my talk, I also put together an ebook that you can read for free online, or purchase in PDF, EPUB, and MOBI formats. There's also a collection of tools and resources to help you on your lean web journey.

Enjoy!
