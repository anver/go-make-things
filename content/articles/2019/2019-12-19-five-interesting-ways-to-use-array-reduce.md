I had the pleasure of writing an article for this year's 24ways Advent Calendar: [Five Interesting Ways to Use `Array.reduce()` (And One Boring Way)](https://24ways.org/2019/five-interesting-ways-to-use-array-reduce/).

If you've struggled to wrap your head around the `Array.reduce()` method, or just want to learn some cool things you can do with it, [this article is for you](https://24ways.org/2019/five-interesting-ways-to-use-array-reduce/).

There's a *ton* of good stuff in this year's series. My favorites include:

- Julie Grundie shows you [how to build a custom autocomplete select menu](https://24ways.org/2019/making-a-better-custom-select-element/)
- Amy Kapernick explains [how to test the front end](https://24ways.org/2019/twelve-days-of-front-end-testing/) (*spoiler: there's a lot of performance and accessibility testing that needs to happen, not just JS.*)
- Michelle Barker looks at [how to create beautiful scrolling experiences with only CSS](https://24ways.org/2019/beautiful-scrolling-experiences-without-libraries/) (*But CSS isn't a real programing language, right? Take that, haters!*)
- Laura Kalbag urges you to [build a personal website, if you don't have one already](https://24ways.org/2019/its-time-to-get-personal/)
- Andy Bell talks [progressive enhancement](https://24ways.org/2019/it-all-starts-with-a-humble-textarea/)
- Frances Berriman digs into one of my favorite topics: [how to make sure the web works well for the next batch of people just connecting for the first time](https://24ways.org/2019/gift-giving-to-the-world-wide-web/)
- Rachel Andrew recalls [the history of CSS (where it's headed next)](https://24ways.org/2019/a-history-of-css-through-15-years-of-24-ways/)
- In what is undoubtedly one of the coolest uses of modern web technology I've ever seen, Chris Mills shows you [how to build a web dictaphone](https://24ways.org/2019/building-a-dictaphone-using-media-recorder-and-getusermedia/)

If you've got time this weekend, lots of good stuff to dig into here!
