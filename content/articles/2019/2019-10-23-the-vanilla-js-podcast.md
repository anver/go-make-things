Last year, I quietly started [the Vanilla JS Podcast](https://vanillajspodcast.com/), a show about JavaScript for people who hate the complexity of modern frontâ€‘end web development.

Every week (or so), I release a new episode. They're generally "coffee break" length, somewhere between 5 and 20 minutes long. In each episode, I share a few thoughts about a focused topic, like career development, or the ethics of the tools we use.

In the future, I may occasionally interview some interesting people.

Last year, I was bit on-again/off-again with the episodes, but I've decided to focus a lot more on the podcast. I upgraded my hosting, and got the podcast listed on more services. I've also quit my role a panelist on JS Jabber.
