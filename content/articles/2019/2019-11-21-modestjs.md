[Pascal Laliberté](https://twitter.com/pascallaliberte) just released a new free ebook, [Modest JS Works](https://modestjs.works/), and it it *really* speaks to me.

> You’ve always been inclined to stay away from the big JavaScript frameworks. **But now you’re within a bigger team**, and it’s a little confounding to you how they just jump on writing some heavy-handed JS right away. **What is this madness?**

I feel _seen_!

In the first half of the book, Pascal starts off by exploring some principles and ideas. Later, in part two, he digs into some concrete, technical specifics.

This feels like a really  nice compliment to [the Lean Web](https://leanweb.dev).
