[I love Artifact Conf.](https://gomakethings.com/a-recap-of-artifact-conf-2019/) In years past, there's been a sketch artist there who created [sketch notes for each talk](https://gomakethings.com/notes-from-artifact-providence-2013/).

This year, [an amazing attendee named Ximena](https://twitter.com/ximenavf92) took sketch notes of each talk and tweeted them out between sessions.

Conference cofounder [Christopher Schmitt](http://christopher.org/) compiled them all into a free ebook. [Click here to download it.](https://github.com/artifactconf/artifactconf2019-sketchnotes)

Special thanks to Ximena for doing this, and to Christopher for putting them all together. It made an already great experience even better!
