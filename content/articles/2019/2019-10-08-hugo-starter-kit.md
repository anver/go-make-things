I am [a huge fan of static website generators](/static-websites/), and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) in particular.

A handful of people I know have tried to use them and gotten stuck, in large part because the documentation assumes people have a level of technical comfort that they might not.

The way I learned was by following Hugo's *Quick Start* guide, and then ripping apart the theme and config file until I figured things out.

I don't want you to have to struggle like that.

To make things easier for people who want to learn, I just released [the Hugo Starter Kit](https://github.com/cferdinandi/hugo-starter). It's a barebones starter project and theme for learning Hugo.

**Included:**

- Archetypes for blog articles and default pages.
- Templates for blog articles and default pages.
- Shortcodes for the current year and markdown inside HTML.
- A custom RSS feed that fixes some of the issues with the default Hugo provides.
- A custom 404 page for easier error page styling.
- Sample .active classes on links to the current page/section in the navigation menus.
- An automatically updating copyright date in the footer.
- A skip navigation link in the header.

**Not Included:**

- CSS
- JavaScript
- Support of any kind
