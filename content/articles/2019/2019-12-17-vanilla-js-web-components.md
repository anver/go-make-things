Last week on Twitter, [Evan Plaice shared a few really cool vanilla JS resources with me](https://twitter.com/evanplaice/status/1204622236717473792).

**[Vanilla Web Components](https://github.com/vanillawc/vanillawc)** is a collection web components built entirely on top of HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript, and native browser APIs. There are no libraries or frameworks involved. Evan also maintains [a collection of vanilla JS plugins and modules](https://github.com/vanillaes).

(*__Full disclosure:__ I haven't tested any of Evan's work for accessibility yet, but it's still an awesome project. If you're looking to get involved in the open source community, this would be a fantastic place to start.*)

Then, later that same day, Dave Rupert shared **[Awesome Standalones](https://github.com/davatron5000/awesome-standalones)**, a curated list of awesome framework-agnostic standalone web components.

Dave's behind projects like the [A11Y Project](https://a11yproject.com/) and [Accessibility Nutrition Cards](https://davatron5000.github.io/a11y-nutrition-cards/), so I put a high degree of confidence in using the things he recommends.

Enjoy!
