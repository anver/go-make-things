Today, I wanted to share two really awesome games people built with vanilla JS.

First up, [Héctor Moreno Cervera create a Pokemon Brawl game](https://hecmocer-pro.github.io/pokemonBrawl/). You can view [the source code for it on GitHub](https://github.com/hecmocer-pro/pokemonBrawl). Perfect for 90s kids!

Second, [Andrea Maille built this super fun Space Invaders game](https://andreamaille.github.io/space-invaders/). Here's [the source code for it on GitHub](https://github.com/andreamaille/space-invaders/). I used to play an arcade version of this back in the 80s, so this one is nostalgia central for me!

I'm wildly impressed with what both Héctor and Andrea did. Go check out their work!
