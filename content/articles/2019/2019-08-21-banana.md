This week, [Victor Ribero tweeted this JavaScript craziness](https://twitter.com/devictoribero/status/1163557735738331138).

```js
// Returns "banana"
('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase();
```

So... what the *hell* is going on here?

## Not a number

The trick is in the `+ + 'a'`, specifically, the `+ 'a'`.

There's no number between the two plus signs. The browser attempts to add nothing to `'a'`, which returns `NaN` (short for *Not a Number*). Using `'a'` is part of the trick to mask what's happening. You could use any string here and it would still work.

Because all of the other characters are strings, the browser coerces `NaN` into a string and concatenates the rest of the string, resulting in `baNaNa`.

The final part of the trick is the `lowerCase()` method, which turns the capital `N`'s from `NaN` into lowercase and hides what's really happening.

## How I figured this out

I was stumped as hell when I first saw this. To be honest, the only reason I figure it out was because of Chrome's awesome "preview as you type" feature in the Console tab of dev tools.

I was typing this out, and as soon as I got to `('b' + 'a' + + 'a')`, it showed, `"baNaN"`.

So, in short: JavaScript is weird, and the people who come up with this stuff are, too.
