Following up on yesterday's post on [the web getting slower](/the-web-is-getting-slower/), [Alex Russell tweeted](https://twitter.com/slightlylate/status/1190313453195427841):

> we should, as a community, come up with some shared principles around what it means to do frontend professionally.

Alex attempted to distill his thoughts down to four principles:

> 1.) If you are not a frontend specialist, choose the most conservative tools (e.g., semantic HTML + CSS) that can plausibly do the job.
> 2.) the experience of the user matters more than the experience of the developer
> 3.) frontenders must value and work to improve P75 and P90 latency as much, or more, than P50 or P25
> 4.) it is a frontender's responsibility to advocate for expanding access to the products and services we build UIs for

These remind me a bit of [the three principles of The Lean Web](https://leanweb.dev):

> 1. Embrace the Platform
> 2. Small & Modular
> 3. The Web is for Everyone

I like Alex's better as guiding principles for our profession, though. In particular, item number two&mdash;user experience > developer experience&mdash;resonates very deeply.

So many of the bad patterns and inaccessible approaches I see on the web today are born out of prioritizing developers over the people that use what they build. That's ass backwards.

Item number three speaks to *web speed percentages*. P90 is the 90th percentile&mdash;some of the slowest internet speeds&mdash;while P25 refers to the top 25 percent of internet speeds/connections.

I also quite like number four: expanding access to what we build.

The web is for everyone, and far too many developers seem to have forgotten that (or never learned it in the first place).
