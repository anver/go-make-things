<a href="http://cferdinandi.github.com/kraken/">Kraken</a> got a few updates last week.

There are <a href="http://cferdinandi.github.com/kraken/addons.html">a few new add-ons</a>, including Spinners, Bar Graph, and Not-A-Modal. FluidVids.js, a third-party script, also made the list.

And thanks to an updated documentation section, getting started with Kraken is now easier than ever. Need some inspiration? See a few examples in the Built With Kraken section.
