title: Two Weeks

Recently, I've come to the realization that I function best in two-week cycles.

I'll spend most of the first week exploring an idea - researching, sketching, researching some more. Then I'll spend a day or two actually building a rough prototype.

Most of the last week is spent making small refinements, and then at the end of the two-week cycle, I ship and move on.

After two weeks, I get bored. I start to over-analyze unimportant details and mess with the soul of the product.

Research. Prototype. Iterate. Ship. All in two weeks. That's my process.
