title: Rethinking the Receipt
---

<a href="http://berglondon.com/blog/2011/06/02/icons-rethink-turning-receipts-into-paper-apps/">Berg Studios</a> has put together an interesting redesign on the common receipt as part of <a href="http://iconeye.com/">Icon Magazine's</a> "Rethink" series.

The concept: Receipts already come loaded with coupons, survey requests and more. Why not put some useful and fun information on there instead, and bring a little joy to people's lives.
