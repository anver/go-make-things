<blockquote>We take the ideas we've inherited or stumbled across, and we jigger them together into some new shape. We like to think of our ideas as a $40,000 incubator, shipped direct from the factory, but in reality they've been cobbled together with spare parts that happened to be sitting in the garage.</blockquote>

The Wall Street Journal has a wonderful article on <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703989304575503730101860838.html?mod=WSJ_Books_LS_Books_2">the origin of good ideas</a>.

<strong>My takeaways:</strong> Figure out what you can build with what you've got, ship early, and modify thing as you go.
