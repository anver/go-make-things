title: Digital Patina
---

As an interesting companion to my post on <a href="https://gomakethings.com/bridges/">the weight (or lack thereof) of digital goods</a>, you should check out Mark Boulton's <a href="http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/digital-patina">article on Digital Patina...</a>

<blockquote>The problem with digital products — our websites, applications, phone applications etc — is they don’t age the same way as some physical things. They either don’t age at all: locked in a permanent state whilst the world changes around them. Or they age in the same way plastic does: slowly decaying into tiny chunks that float about for eternity. Always there. Never to be used. Of little significant value. You see, producing digital products is not a sustainable practice.

How can we impart a digital patina on the things we use. What is the flavour of an application? Iteration? Code? UX?</blockquote>

It's the kind of post that, for me anyways, raises more questions than it answers. I'd love to hear your thoughts.
