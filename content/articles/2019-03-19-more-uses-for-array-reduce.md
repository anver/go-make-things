Last week, [we looked at the `Array.reduce()` method](/using-array.reduce-in-vanilla-js/).

A few days earlier, [Matthew Gerstman had shared an article on a few of the array methods](https://twitter.com/MatthewGerstman/status/1107807169087528960), and my friend [Alessandro Muraro](https://twitter.com/akmur) and I asked Matthew a few questions about `Array.reduce()`.

He was kind enough to put together [an entire article with some detailed examples of things you can do with the `Array.reduce()` method](https://www.matthewgerstman.com/tech/reduce-reduce-reduce/).

It includes things like group and reorganizing objects, flattening, chunking, and more. [Go read the whole thing.](https://www.matthewgerstman.com/tech/reduce-reduce-reduce/)

Thanks Matthew!
