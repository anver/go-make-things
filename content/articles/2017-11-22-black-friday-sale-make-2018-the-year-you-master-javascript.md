Let's make 2018 the year you master JavaScript!

From Black Friday (November 24, 2017) through Cyber Monday (November 27, 2017), I'm running the biggest sale of the year on [my JS learning resources](/resources/).

## The Details

- All of my [Vanilla JS Pocket Guides](/guides/) are 50% off.
- If you think you could benefit from some 1-on-1 help, my [JavaScript consulting calls](/call/) are also 50% off.
- Want to deep dive into JS? My [private JavaScript mentoring program](/mentoring/) is 30% off for as long as you're in the program.
- Pre-order my *brand new* [video mini courses](/courses/) and save 50% (more details below).

## NEW: Video courses!

Many of my students have mentioned that while they learn best from watching videos, most of the courses that are available are long, boring, and overwhelming.

An 8-hour JavaScript course? Who has time for that?

I'm taking pre-orders for my new [Vanilla JS Mini Courses](/courses/)&mdash;short, focused video courses made for beginners.

Normally, you'd save 30% by pre-ordering the course, but starting on Black Friday, you'll save 50% off the retail price! And as an added bonus, you'll also get instant access to the pocket guides, my vanilla JS toolkit, and my private Slack room.

## Special bonus gifts

As if these deals weren't great enough, every pocket guide bundle, consulting call, mentor program, and mini course comes with **$563 worth of bonus gifts and special discounts** for other learning resources.

*__Note:__ Only the Pocket Guide Bundles are eligible. Individual pocket guides don't qualify, sorry!*

## I'm ready!

The sale kicks-off tomorrow at midnight and runs for just four days. Make 2018 the year you master JavaScript and save big!
