title: You can&#8217;t read everything

In explaining why he created the ultra-minimal website <a href="http://guardian.gyford.com/">Today's Guardian</a>, <a href="http://www.gyford.com/phil/writing/2010/06/09/todays-guardian.php">Phil Gyford noted...</a>

<blockquote>When I read a newspaper I’m holding a coherent package of news. “Here,” it says, “is what you should know today.” Once I’ve read it — or, at least, flicked through it — I know I’m up to date. I don’t need to read anything until tomorrow’s newspaper, which will catch me up with everything that happened in the intervening time. And while I’m reading the paper I know how much there is remaining — the pages in my right hand — and I know when I’m done.

This is very much not the case with a news website. There is no sense of an ending. There is no way I can be sure I’ve at least decided whether to read “everything”. There is, on most websites, no way I can be sure I’ve seen all that’s been published since I last visited.</blockquote>

And that may be social media's biggest problem. There's just too much out there. You can't read everything, and there's now a nagging feeling that you're missing something.

That's why (as <a href="http://knowhr.com">Frank Roche</a> and <a href="thought-hoarder.tumblr.com">Paul Hebert</a> have both noted on occasion) curation is so important. We need editors.

I think there's a real need for this inside organizations as well. As more and more companies adopt social media tools internally, there's a real value in someone who can pull together the <em>best of</em> information and organize it in logical or easy-to-navigate ways.
