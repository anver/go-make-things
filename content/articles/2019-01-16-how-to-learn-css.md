I talk often about how JavaScript developers *need* to know CSS. The natural follow-up question is, "how do I learn?"

A few weeks ago [I shared some learning resources](/learning-css/), but the amazing Rachel Andrews just dropped [a *must-read* article on how to learn CSS](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/01/how-to-learn-css/):

> You donâ€™t need to commit to memorizing every CSS Property and Value, as there are good places to look them up. There are some fundamental things, however, which will make CSS much easier for you to use. This article aims to guide you along your path of learning CSS.

Seriously, if you're only going to read one tutorial on CSS, [make it this one](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/01/how-to-learn-css/).
