I just learned that [Jetpack for WordPress now offers a personal plan](https://jetpack.com/install/personal/) for just $39 a year.

This comes with a 30-day archive of automated off-site backups with automated restores if something goes wrong.

This makes it cheaper than their standalone [VaultPress](https://vaultpress.com/jetpack/) product. That's absurdly affordable.
