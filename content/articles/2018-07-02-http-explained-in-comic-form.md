Web developer [Mariko Kosaka](https://kosamari.com/) put together [a delightful set of drawings explaining what HTTP *actually is*](https://twitter.com/kosamari/status/859958929484337152?s=21), and the differences between HTTP1.x and HTTP2.

The tl;dr: HTTP is the *protocol* servers and browsers use to talk to each other, and HTTP2 is a more efficient way of doing so that corrects some of the mistakes we made with HTTP1.x.

Go check out the drawings, though. They're fantastic!
