title: Hero Pit Bull
---

A pit bull saved her family - both human and animal - from a fire that destroyed their entire house. <a href="http://www.ilovedogs.com/2013/02/hero-pit-bull-saves-women-and-dogs-from-house-fire/">From I Love Dogs...</a>

<blockquote>Rhonda Westenberger and her sister, Evelyn, were both sound asleep early Tuesday morning when they were awakened by the nonstop barking of their 10-year-old Pit Bull, Baby, who nudged and pounced on the women. [...]

The sisters made it safely out of their burning house in Wellston, Okla., but their five other dogs were still inside.

“There was one hiding underneath the bed,” family member Charles Land told KOCO. “Baby actually went in there, grabbed it by the neck and [dragged] it outside.”

The house was destroyed, but everyone living in it survived, thanks to Baby.</blockquote>

This is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVIwQAoEBAQ">the second story I've read in the last year</a> about a pit bull dragging people to safety. What amazing dogs.
