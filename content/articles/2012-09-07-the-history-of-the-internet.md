title: The History of the Internet
---

Web education company <a href="http://www.grovo.com/">Grovo</a> has used <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Grovo/info">their Facebook timeline</a> to showcase the history of the internet. Very cool!

Here are some of my favorites...

<ul>
<li>1536 - First known instance of the @ symbol used in a letter by a Florentine merchant. Who knew?</li>
<li>1963 - The first computer mouse is invented by Douglas Engelbart. I also didn't realize the mouse was that old.</li>
<li>1972 - Email is invented.</li>
<li>1978 - The first spam email is sent. That didn't take long. Bummer.</li>
<li>1989 - Peapod launches the first online grocery store. I'm shocked that Peapod is this old.</li>
<li>1997 - Google is born. I thought Google was older than that.</li>
<li>2003 - MySpace, WordPress and LinkedIn launch. Hell of a year!</li>
<li>2004 - Gmail launches. Facebook is released. Again, though these were older.</li>
<li>Also 2004 - Mozilla releases Firefox web browser. So begins the end of the Internet Explorer's rein of <del datetime="2012-08-30T13:38:31+00:00">glory</del> tyranny.</li>
<li>2005 - YouTube launches. Is it really that young?</li>
<li>2006 - Jack Dorsey creates Twitter. That means Twitter is 7 years old. Wow.</li>
</ul>

If there's one takeaway for me, it's that internet time moves differently than real world time. I'm amazed at how recently many of the services I know and love were created.
