Out-of-the-box, [Easy Digital Downloads](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/) sends people to checkout even when a product is free.

I wanted to avoid this step by just collecting a customer's email address and sending them a confirmation email without them having to leave the sales page. So, I created [EDD Free Purchases](https://github.com/cferdinandi/gmt-edd-free-purchases).

It setups a shortcode you can use to embed an email signup form on any page on your site. When the customer submits their email, the product is automatically purchased and they're sent a confirmation email.

Enjoy!
