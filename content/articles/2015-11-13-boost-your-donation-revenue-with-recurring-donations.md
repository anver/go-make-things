title: Boost your donation revenue with recurring donations
---

One of the simplest ways to smooth out cash flow *and* increase your overall donation revenue is by asking for recurring donations. This helps you break out of the feast or famine seasonal donation cycle and gain some cash flow continuity.

## Smaller amounts mean bigger donations over time

Smaller, recurring donations are easier for a donor to get onboard with *and* result in larger overall donations over the course of a year. According to research by Network for Good, [recurring donors give 42-percent more in one year than one-time donors do](http://www.networkforgood.com/nonprofitblog/new-infographic-why-recurring-giving-matters/).

Let's do some simple math. Let's say your average one-time donation is $25. A $5 monthly donation-the cost of a coffee and a donut-results in $60 of donations over the course of a year. And assuming your recurring donors don't stop giving after 12 months, that revenue continues year-after-year!

Not only are you getting more money, but it becomes predictable revenue that you can use to better plan your budget over the course of the year.

## How to get more recurring donors

It's actually absurdly simple: ask.

At the end of your donation form, just before the submit button, provide a simple checkbox that asks, "Would you like to make this a monthly donation?"

If you pair this with some comparative pricing, you can really drive recurring donations. For example, you might say something like, "For just $10 a month, less than the cost of lunch, you can provide feed a dog for a month."

## You can do this on your website right now

Visit your donation page and look for a recurring donation option.

1. If there is one, awesome! If you don't already have any comparative pricing language on the page, spend a few minutes writing some examples you can share with potential donors.
2. If you don't have a recurring donations option, set one up!
