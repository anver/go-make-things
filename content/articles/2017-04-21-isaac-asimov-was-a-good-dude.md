Taking a break from code for today. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a> (the guy who wrote, among other things, iRobot) was a really good dude.

<a href="https://twitter.com/LettersOfNote/status/849955150320082944">Letters of Note published a few of his letters.</a> They're delightful.
