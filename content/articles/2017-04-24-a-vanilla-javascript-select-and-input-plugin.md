title: A vanilla JavaScript select and input plugin

***Update:*** *My friend (and accessibility expert) [Scott O'Hara](http://www.scottohara.me/) tells me that this plugin is really bad for people who use screen readers. Accordingly, I'm rescinding my recommendation.*

<a href="https://github.com/jshjohnson/Choices">Choices</a> is a vanilla JavaScript plugin that let's you easily create configurable select box/text inputs.

I worry a little about the accessibility of this, and would love to see some testing on this with people who use assistive technology. But still, this is definitely going into my toolbox of plugins to use in the future.
