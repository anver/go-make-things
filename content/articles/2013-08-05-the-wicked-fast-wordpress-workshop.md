I'm running a four-hour workshop on <a href="http://2013.providence.wordcamp.org/tickets/">Wicked Fast WordPress at WordCamp Providence</a>.

<strong>When:</strong> Friday, August 16
<strong>Where:</strong> URI Providence Campus, 80 Washington Stree, Providence, RI

In this interactive, hands-on workshop, I'll be sharing tips, tricks and techniques I've used to build WordPress sites that load in under one second on cheap commodity hosting.

Not sure what to expect? Check out <a href="https://gomakethings.com/wicked-fast-wordpress/">the talk I gave</a> a few weeks ago. I hope to see you there!
