title: The Scroll and eReader
---

Last month, the <em>New York Times</em> took <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/04/books/review/the-mechanic-muse-from-scroll-to-screen.html">a fascinating look at the evolution of the written word</a>, from the scroll, to the modern book (or codex, as it was originally known) to the modern ereader.

<blockquote>The codex also came with a fringe benefit: It created a very different reading experience. With a codex, for the first time, you could jump to any point in a text instantly, nonlinearly. You could flip back and forth between two pages and even study them both at once. You could cross-check passages and compare them and bookmark them. You could skim if you were bored, and jump back to reread your favorite parts. It was the paper equivalent of random-access memory, and it must have been almost supernaturally empowering. With a scroll you could only trudge through texts the long way, linearly.</blockquote>

Despite my love of technology, I prefer to read physical books. I love the tactile feel of paper as I flip the pages, and the aesthetic of printed letters (though the Kindle's eInk is quite easy on the eyes).

But if I had to name one thing that I dislike the most about ereaders, it's <em>how</em> I read stuff that's on a screen - like a scroll.

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/04/books/review/the-mechanic-muse-from-scroll-to-screen.html">Head over the <em>NYT</em> and read the full article.</a> It's short and fascinating.
