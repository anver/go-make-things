<blockquote>Well-designed products simply last longer.

- <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1664485/why-american-brands-cant-get-sustainability-right">Jens Martin Skibsted and Rasmus Bech Hansen</a></blockquote>

Co.Design wrote a great piece on <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1664485/why-american-brands-cant-get-sustainability-right">innovation and sustainability</a> a few weeks ago.

The authors speculate that America's innovation skills are also what make us suck at sustainability. Instead of constantly making new stuff, we should focus on making standardized, longer lasting, more useful stuff.

It reminded me a bit of the awesome website, <a href="http://lastyearsmodel.org/">Last Year's Model</a>.
