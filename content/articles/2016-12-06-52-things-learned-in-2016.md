[This list of things Tom Whitwell learned in 2016](https://medium.com/fluxx-studio-notes/52-things-i-learned-in-2016-299fd1e6a62b) is too good!

Some examples:

> Twitter has enough money in the bank to run for 412 years with current losses.

> Most iPhone case manufacturers don’t get advance notice from Apple about new designs; they rely on rumours. Case maker Hard Candy went out of business after producing 50,000 custom-moulded cases for a leaked iPhone design that never appeared.

> Intervision, the 70s Soviet answer to the Eurovision Song Contest, was judge by electricity grid voting: “those watching at home had to turn their lights on when they liked a song and off when they didn’t, with data from the electricity network then being used to allocate points.”
