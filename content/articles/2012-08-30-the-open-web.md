<blockquote>Itâ€™s worth remembering what Sir Tim Berners-Lee did 21 years ago, when he created the first truly open internet-based platform: namely, the World Wide Web. In an early interview about his invention, Berners-Lee confessed there was a time where he considered taking a different route and trying to profit from what he had developed, but he chose a different path. The amount of social and commercial value that has been created as a result is almost impossible to calculate.</blockquote>

It's worth reading the whole piece for an interesting look at the history of the web. But what jumped out at me was this reference to AOL...

<blockquote>Thanks to Berners-Lee, the web has never been a commercial entity, or it probably would have turned into something like AOL or CompuServe.</blockquote>

Today, Facebook and Twitter are in many ways trying to be what AOL was a decade or two ago: your one-stop place for content on the internet, where visitors spend increasingly large amounts of time. Will they suffer the same fate as a result?
