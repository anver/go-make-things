When I talk about mobile-friendly design, I'm really using a familiar shorthand for "device-agnostic design."

What I mean by that is that your website should work on any device that can access the web: smartphones and tablets, of course, but also smart TVs, gaming consoles, and these days, even cars.

If people can access your website on a device, they will. Over the last three years, [PAWS New England's website](http://pawsnewnegland.com) has been visiting by over 800 different kinds of web-connected devices, including a Nintendo DS.

## It forces you to focus on your entire user experience

The wonderful thing about focusing on mobile-friendly design, though, is that when you focus on making sure your site works anywhere, you start paying more attention to the entire experience of interacting with your organization in a way that you didn't before.

You [prioritize performance over flashy features](/how-much-revenue-is-your-slow-website-costing-you/), which helps increase the number of people who visit your site and your overall revenue.

You make sure [your site works even when code breaks or files don't load](/how-to-make-sure-your-website-works-on-thousands-of-devices-without-losing-your-mind/), and as a result your visitors can access your content faster, which makes them happy.

You [ensure that people who are color blind, visually impaired, or suffer from neurological and muscular disabilities are still able to use your website](/design-for-color-blindness/), which helps you reach more people *and* provides a better experience for people without disabilities, too.

You [reduce the number of fields on your forms](/how-to-build-donation-forms-that-bring-in-more-revenue/), which makes them easier to complete for everyone, not just mobile users.

You make sure that everyone, everywhere, can [start using your site on one device, then continue on another](/the-mobile-context-myth/), without any break in the user experience.

## A better user experience is better for your bottom line

Is it any wonder that mobile-friendly websites generate more revenue than desktop-only sites&mdash;even when someone visits from a desktop computer?

Done right, they provide a better experience for everyone.
