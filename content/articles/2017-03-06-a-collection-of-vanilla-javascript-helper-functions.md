title: A collection of vanilla JavaScript helper functions
---

Over the weekend, I released [a collection of vanilla JavaScript helper functions](https://gomakethings.com/open-source/#javascript-helper-functions).

They were originally included in my (now defunct) JavaScript API Cheat Sheet, but I thought they'd be easier to use (and reach more people) on GitHub. Enjoy!

Oh, and if there anything you can do in jQuery that you'd like to know how to do in vanilla JavaScript, [send me an email](https://gomakethings.com/about/) and let me know.
