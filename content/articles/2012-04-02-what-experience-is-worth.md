title: What experience is worth

I believe that creativity, curiosity and passion are worth more than a degree or the right background. That said, sometimes there's just no substitute for experience.

Check out this itemized bill sent to Henry Ford...

Experience is how you learn where to make the mark. It costs you time to acquire. There are no shortcuts, just hard work.

And that's why it's worth so damn much.

<em><strong>PS:</strong> I'm told Ford paid the bill.</em>
