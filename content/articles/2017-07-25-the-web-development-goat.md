title: The Web Development GOAT
---

In addition to pirates and Pixar movies, I'm a *huge* fan of hip-hop.

Hip-hop is at it's core a very competitive genre, and a never-ending topic of debate within the community is: who's the GOAT, the Greatest of All Time. Every hip-hop fan has a top 5 list.

So, who's the GOAT of web development? Here's my top 5 list.

1. [John Resig](https://johnresig.com/), inventor of [jQuery](http://jquery.com/). Yes, my whole site is about how to *not* use jQuery. But without jQuery, none of these great, modern JS APIs that I love would even exist. John dragged browser makers forward with his incredible project.
2. [Eric Meyer](http://meyerweb.com/) is an institution. He helped drive web standards that make working across browsers infinitely easier. He gave us the [CSS reset](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/). He cofounded [An Event Apart](https://aneventapart.com/). He gives so much to our community.
3. [Nicole Sullivan](http://www.stubbornella.org/) is the originator of [OOCSS](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki), but she never gets credit for it. OOCSS led to BEM, and has changed the way I and so many people architect CSS.
4. [Chris Coyier](https://css-tricks.com/), who teaches everyone how to code. [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) literally taught me web development and helped me change careers. [Code Pen](https://codepen.io/) gives people an easy way to experiment and play with web technology.
5. [Ethan Marcotte](https://ethanmarcotte.com/), who coined the term [Responsive Web Design](https://responsivewebdesign.com/) and completely changed how we build for the web.

If I were to do a top 10 list, [Sara Soueidan](http://www.sarasoueidan.com/), [Brad Frost](http://bradfrost.com/), and [Lea Verou](http://lea.verou.me/).

(*I'm painfully aware that there's only one woman in my top 5, and that's one me to fix.*)

So, who's in your top 5?
