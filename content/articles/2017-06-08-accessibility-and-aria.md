I find ARIA incredibility confusing.

Quick aside: ARIA is an acronym for "Accessible Rich Internet Applications." [Mozilla Developer Network explains:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA)

> [ARIA] defines ways to make Web content and Web applications (especially those developed with Ajax and JavaScript) more accessible to people with disabilities. For example, ARIA enables accessible navigation landmarks, JavaScript widgets, form hints and error messages, live content updates, and more.

Ok, so... I never when to use ARIA roles vs. rely on native HTML elements, which roles to use, and so on. It's my achilles heel.

I found [this primer on ARIA from WebAIM](http://webaim.org/blog/aria-cause-solution/) super helpful at clearing up some of my confusion. Maybe you will, too.
