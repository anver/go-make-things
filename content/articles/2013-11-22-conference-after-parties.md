Mark Boulton wrote an awesome article on <a href="http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/conferencetips">tips for conference organizers</a> from a speakers perspective. My favorite is #9:

<blockquote>
  <em>Alcohol.</em> Again, this is personal, but not everyone likes a piss-up. So, the after party should not necessarily be at a club where you can’t hear yourself think with as much free spirits as you can drink. Consider attendees may want to talk amongst themselves in a grown-up setting after a long day sat down. We’re not all party-animals.
</blockquote>

Count me in that category. I'd gladly choose an after-party at a coffee house over one at a bar any day of the week.
