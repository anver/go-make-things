title: Henry Miller&#8217;s 11 Commandments for Making Things
---

From Maria Popova's Brain Pickings comes this delightful list of <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2012/02/22/henry-miller-on-writing/">commandments for more effective creative work</a>.

<blockquote>In 1932-1933, while working on what would become his first published novel, <em>Tropic of Cancer</em>, Miller devised and adhered to a stringent daily routine to propel his writing.

<ol>
<li>Work on one thing at a time until finished.</li>
<li>Start no more new books, add no more new material to ‘Black Spring.’</li>
<li>Don’t be nervous. Work calmly, joyously, recklessly on whatever is in hand.</li>
<li>Work according to Program and not according to mood. Stop at the appointed time!</li>
<li>When you can’t create you can work.</li>
<li>Cement a little every day, rather than add new fertilizers.</li>
<li>Keep human! See people, go places, drink if you feel like it.</li>
<li>Don’t be a draught-horse! Work with pleasure only.</li>
<li>Discard the Program when you feel like it—but go back to it next day. Concentrate. Narrow down. Exclude.</li>
<li>Forget the books you want to write. Think only of the book you are writing.</li>
<li>Write first and always. Painting, music, friends, cinema, all these come afterwards.</li>
</ol>
