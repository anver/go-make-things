Each week, I come across a bunch of awesome stuff that doesn't make it on to the blog. I've started a free weekly email, the [Spare Parts Newsletter](/newsletter/), as a place to share things like:

* Links to interesting articles and videos.
* New tools and techniques.
* Interesting stuff thatâ€™s *not* about web development.
* A summary of the articles on my site from the last week.
