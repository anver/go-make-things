Yesterday, I neglected to include [Polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io/v2/docs/) in my list of polyfills.

Polyfill.io is a service that reads the user agent of your visitor's browser and automatically serves up just the polyfills that they need.

I haven't personally used it on any projects yet, but it's been recommended to me a handful of times. Check it out.
