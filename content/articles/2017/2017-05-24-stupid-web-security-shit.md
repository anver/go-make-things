title: Stupid web security shit
---

Troy Hunt has put together an article documenting <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/reckon-youve-seen-some-stupid-security-things-here-hold-my-beer/">some of the stupid web security shit he's seen in his travels</a>.

One example: an error message stating that your desired password is already used by another user.

More shocking to me than some of these issues is how defensively corporations seems to respond when you let them know. Eesh!
