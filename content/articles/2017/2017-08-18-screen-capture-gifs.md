I've been using <a href="https://www.cockos.com/licecap/">LICECap</a> for quite a while to create animated GIFs of my screen.

<a href="https://twitter.com/zachleat/status/885534152963088385">Zach Leatherman</a> recently tipped me off to <a href="https://getkap.co/">Kap</a>, a Mac-only tool that does the same thing, but with a much nicer interface and better options.

If you're looking for a way to easily report interactive bugs, show off animations, and so on, it's an awesome tool.
