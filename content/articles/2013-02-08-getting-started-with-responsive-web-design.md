title: Getting started with Responsive Web Design

Trent Walton has an excellent post on <a href="http://trentwalton.com/2013/02/07/where-to-start/">getting started with Responsive Web Design</a>. He writes...

<blockquote>Whether itâ€™s CSS for a single component or an entire site, I finish in a mobile-first fashion by using min-width media queries to set the smallest view and move outward from there. However, I start much differently. I begin with wide views because the layout is usually more complex. I find it easier to ensure columns and spacing are set wide and work my way down to a single column.</blockquote>

I know it goes against the letter of mobile first to design the big screen layout first, but I do that, too, and for pretty much the same reasons Trent describes.

Trent's article is awesome, by the way. <a href="http://trentwalton.com/2013/02/07/where-to-start/">Go read the whole thing now.</a>
