title: Announcing &#8220;Vanilla JavaScript for Beginners&#8221;
---

A lot of people have told me that they learn code better through video, and prefer seeing code in action over just reading about how it works.

I'm working on a new video course, [Vanilla JavaScript for Beginners](/courses/vanilla-javascript-for-beginners/).

This step-by-step video training is short, focused, and made for beginners. No foo/bar bullsh*t. No terminal window. No “just [do this really complicated thing].”

Together, we’ll build a feature-rich show/hide script. You’ll walk away with a real, working project and solid understanding of foundational JavaScript.

If you’re sick of hostile answers on StackOverflow, bad documentation, and tutorials that assume you have a Computer Science degree, this is for you.

The course is still under development, but if you **[pre-order today](/courses/vanilla-javascript-for-beginners/#pre-order-and-save-50), you'll save 50%.**

I'll be doubling the price of the course when it goes live. If you want to be the first to get it *and* save a ton of cash, nows your chance.
