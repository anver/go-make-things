One tool I've found absolutely indispensable over the last year or so is [Sip](https://sipapp.io/), a tool that let's you grab colors from anything on your screen with a point-and-click.

It's unfortunately Mac-only. I managed to snag a copy back when it was free. It's now $10, but if you frequently need to pull colors from people's static design comps, well worth it.
