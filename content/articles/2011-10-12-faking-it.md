title: Faking it

The Dunkin' Donut right near my house is easily the second worst Dunkin' I've ever been to.

They often get my order wrong. They're rude. They don't give you napkins at the drive-thru window. Did I mention they get my order wrong a lot?

Today, I noticed something different. Instead, "Can I take your order?" I was greeted with, "Thank you for choosing Dunkin' Donuts today. What can I get you?" They're trying to change, right?

Except the woman who asked me sounded miserable. She was faking it.

There's another Dunkin' a few miles further down the road. When you pull up to the drive-thru window, they ask, "How are you this morning?" And then pause and wait for you to answer. They're not faking it.

Good service isn't just about processes and procedures. It's about little details. It's about meaning it when you say things.
