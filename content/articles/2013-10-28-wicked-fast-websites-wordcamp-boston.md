title: 'Wicked Fast Websites: WordCamp Boston'
---

Over the weekend, I gave a talk on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/cferdinandi/wicked-fast-wordpress-wordcamp-boston-2013">how to build wicked fast websites with WordPress</a> at WordCamp Boston. I had the pleasure of speaking directly after <a href="http://ethanmarcotte.com/">Ethan Marcotte</a>, and his talk on <a href="http://vimeo.com/63525054">the Map and the Territory</a> was a nice compliment to why performance matters so much.
