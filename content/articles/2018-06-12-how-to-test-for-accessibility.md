Last week, I shared some thoughts on [why you shouldn't use analytics data to determine what it is your users want](/your-website-data-is-a-lie/).

Reader Kevin Fitzhenry asked (shared with permission):

> Is there a screenreader simulator or some sort, or an online tool that can assess how optimized your site is for accessibility?

I'm an a11y advocate, but I'm far from an expert. So, I consulted my friends [Scott O'Hara](https://www.scottohara.me/) and [Eric Bailey](https://ericwbailey.design/), who *are* experts.

Here's what they had to say.

> **Scott:** macOS has VoiceOver built in for free. iOS has has VoiceOver built in for free. Android phones can get TalkBack (for free).
> Windows can use Narrator (primarily with IE/Edge) for free. Windows can use NVDA with FireFox/Chrome for free. Windows can use JAWS in free trial mode for a short period of time.
>
> **Eric:** The important part about manual testing is that you want to make sure your logic and markup work the way theyâ€™re intended. Automated checkers can hit false positives, and things like `<h1 aria-hidden="true">Very important information</h1>` are technically valid, but also an awful experience for the end user.

So in short: grab a free screen reader and try using your website with it. You'll learn a lot!
