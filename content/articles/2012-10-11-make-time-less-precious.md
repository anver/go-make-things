title: Make Time Less Precious

From Caterina Fake's post on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20121002125913-3279-how-to-create-time">creating time...</a>

<blockquote>We are way too efficient, making use of every hour, every minute. When you were a kid, didn't you just spend hours poking sticks in the mud, climbing trees and sitting in them, looking at shells and seaweed that washed up on the shoreline? Time was not precious then, we weren't trying to stuff an accomplishment into every minute every day, we had time for thoughts and feelings. That was good! Any day spent that way was a day of joy and order. There was so much time.</blockquote>
