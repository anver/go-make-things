In last week's post on [whether or not progressive enhancement still matters](/does-progressive-enhancement-still-matter/), I wrote:

> So, I like to build in layers and provide proper fallbacks that you enhance on top of… not for the “disable JS” people, but for everyone else who doesn’t have control over what happens.

So, how many people is that, exactly? [The good folks at gov.uk wanted to find out](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/10/21/how-many-people-are-missing-out-on-javascript-enhancement/), and put together a little test.

**The found that 1 in every 93 visitors were _not_ getting JavaScript enhancements.**

They also found that 81% of the people *not* getting JavaScript enhancements *had JavaScript turned on*. They *should* have gotten the JavaScript enhancements, but they didn't.

Progressive enhancement matters. A lot.
