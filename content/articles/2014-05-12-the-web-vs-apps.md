[This from Luke Wroblewski](https://twitter.com/lukew/status/465630836146974721):

> Sad how the Web is now a shill for mobile app installs. Web designers/developers you can stop this. Don't let others shit where you work.

[And this from XKCD](http://xkcd.com/1367/):

<p class="text-center"><img alt="Installing things has gotten so fast and painless. Why not skip it entirely, and make a phone that has every app installed already and just downloads and runs them on the fly. Oh wait, that's the internet." src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/installing.png"></p>

See also, [FastActive](https://github.com/jonathanstark/FastActive), an awesome little vanilla JS script that makes web apps feel as fast as native ones by removing the lag from tap to active state.
