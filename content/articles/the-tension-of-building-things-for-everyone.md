Last week, I had the pleasure of joining the amazing [Jennifer Robbins](https://twitter.com/jenville), cofounder of Artifact Conference, on [the Shop Talk Show podcast](https://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/365/).

We talked about [Artifact Conference](https://artifactconf.com/), where Chris Coyier, Dave Rupert, and I will all be speaking this September.

The high-level theme for the event is designing and developing for everyone (and the struggles that come with that). There are some amazing talks lined up, and we explored a few of them in a bit more detail.
