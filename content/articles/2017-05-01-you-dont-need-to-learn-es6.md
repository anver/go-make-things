So... do you need to learn ES6? No. You don't.

Especially for application development ES6 has a ton of awesome new features. But you can build apps 100% vanilla with ES5. For DOM manipulation, ES5 is also more than sufficient.

[Backwards compatibility still sucks](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/), so if you do use it, you need to run your code through a processor like Babel to get JS that can be used by  more than just the latest browsers.

Now, this doesn't mean you *shouldn't* learn ES6. Understanding JavaScript more deeply is a great thing.

But not knowing it won't hold you back from writing awesome scripts and plugins.
