More brilliance from <a href="http://www.damniwish.com/2011/07/ill-give-you-an-ipad-if-youll-be-my-friend.html">Andy Sernovitz of Damn, I Wish I Thought of That...</a>

<blockquote>I’ll give you an iPad if you’ll be my friend!

Imagine if you said that to a real person. It’s like saying, “I’m desperate for friends, but I’ll pay you to hang out with me.”

Folks, true friendship does not involve a cash transaction.</blockquote>

Don't ask people to give you their name, email address and phone number to get a copy of that pathetically mediocre white paper you wrote. Instead, write a fun, useful, non-spammy guide that people will <em>love and share</em> with their friends and coworkers, and give it away no-strings-attached.

Don't give away the next Apple iThing to people, but only if they follow you and retweet your spammy 140-character-or-less lame excuse for marketing copy. Instead, share insights and information compelling enough that people <em>want</em> to follow you.

Social media marketing isn't hard, but it's not traditional marketing, either. It's about connections and relationships.

Spend time cultivating those and watch your brand grow.
