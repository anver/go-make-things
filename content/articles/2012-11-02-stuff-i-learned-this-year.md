title: Stuff I Learned This Year
---

A few weeks ago I launched <a href="https://gomakethings.com/work/jetpack/">JetPack</a>, a project that started as a "what if" brainstorming session back in January.

As I was thinking about the project and the various things that went into it, I realized I learned how to do a <em>lot</em> of things this year. Between JetPack and a few side projects, here's some of the stuff I've learned this year:

<ul>
<li>Mobile First</li>
<li>How to use icon fonts</li>
<li>HTML5 semantics</li>
<li>Javascript and jQuery</li>
<li>jQuery UI Drag & Drop and Sortables</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>How to write WordPress plugins</li>
<li>AJAX (sort of... I'm getting there)</li>
<li>Twitter Bootstrap</li>
<li>CSS3 gradients</li>
<li>Grid-based layouts</li>
<li>HTML5 video with flash fallback</li>
<li>Web accessibility</li>
<li>Typography-based web design</li>
<li>Browser caching</li>
<li>Performance optimized web images</li>
<li>Image sprites</li>
<li>SASS</li>
</ul>

This is such an exciting time to working on and with the web. I can't wait to see what I'll learn next year.
