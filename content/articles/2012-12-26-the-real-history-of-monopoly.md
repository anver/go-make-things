Monopoly has long been one of my favorite board games. I own the board game, a version for Wii, and the iPhone app.

I found this Harper's Magazine article on <a href="http://harpers.org/blog/2012/10/monopoly-is-theft/?single=1">the real history of Monopoly</a> fascinating (yes, I'm a nerd).

What's particularly interesting is that in the original incarnation of the game, the objective was not to bankrupt all of the other players, but rather to work cooperatively as a way to achieve greater success.

<blockquote>The official history of Monopoly, as told by Hasbro, which owns the brand, states that the board game was invented in 1933 by an unemployed steam-radiator repairman and part-time dog walker from Philadelphia named Charles Darrow. Darrow had dreamed up what he described as a real estate trading game whose property names were taken from Atlantic City, the resort town where he’d summered as a child. Patented in 1935 by Darrow and the corporate game maker Parker Brothers, Monopoly sold just over 2 million copies in its first two years of production, making Darrow a rich man and likely saving Parker Brothers from bankruptcy...

The game’s true origins, however, go unmentioned in the official literature. Three decades before Darrow’s patent, in 1903, a Maryland actress named Lizzie Magie created a proto-Monopoly as a tool for teaching the philosophy of Henry George, a nineteenth-century writer who had popularized the notion that no single person could claim to “own” land. In his book Progress and Poverty (1879), George called private land ownership an “erroneous and destructive principle” and argued that land should be held in common, with members of society acting collectively as “the general landlord.”</blockquote>
