title: Make my friend shave his head
---

My friend Chris is walking for the Easter Seals this year, and if he raises $3,000, he'll shave his head.

You don't know Chris, so you probably don't realize what a big deal this is. Chris has had the same haircut for the last 15 years. And quite frankly, I'm not sure he'll look all that good without hair.

Last year, Chris met his goal and walked in a tutu. Let's make this happen!

<h2>About the Walk</h2>

Easter Seals Walk With Me is a national fundraising event that spreads hope and raises funds to support families living with disabilities. Last year, over 23,000 people from across the country joined their local Walk With Me events and, together, raised $3.8 million.

My friend Chris works for CVS/Caremark, a National Premiere Sponsor of the event.
