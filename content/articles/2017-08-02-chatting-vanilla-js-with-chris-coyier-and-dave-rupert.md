title: Chatting vanilla JS with Chris Coyier and Dave Rupert
---

A few weeks ago, I had the pleasure of chatting about [vanilla JavaScript with Chris Coyier and Dave Rupert over on the Shop Talk Show](https://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/274-vanilla-js-chris-ferdinandi/).

Chris, Dave, and I talked about a bunch of stuff, including what role libraries and frameworks play today, what makes vanilla JavaScript vanilla, and how polyfills are bridging the gap and making things easier.
