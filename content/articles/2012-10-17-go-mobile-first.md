This isn't a framework. Actually, it's the opposite of a framework. I've removed as much as possible, so you have a simple, clean foundation to build on.

I've also added lots of comments to make things as easy for you as possible.

<h2>What is mobile-first?</h2>

Mobile-first is an approach to web design that's kind of like graceful degredation in reverse. You start with a collection of basic styles that work on all browsers (including older browsers and not-so-smart phones), and then add progressive enhancements for more capable browers/devices and bigger screens.

But mobile-first is about more than just how a site looks. While this theme is deliberately lightweight, you should also take some additional steps to <a href="https://gomakethings.com/how-to-trick-out-the-performance-of-your-wordpress-site/">improve the performance of your site</a>.

<h2>What does it look like?</h2>

<em>Go Mobile First</em> is a modified version of this site.

It includes a fluid single column layout, responsive text, and a collapsing navigation menu on smaller screens for browsers that support it.

<h2>Powered by HTML 5</h2>

This theme makes use of the new HTML5 semantics. If you haven't used them before, you might want to familiarize yourself with them. <em><a href="http://diveintohtml5.info/semantics.html">Dive Into HTML5</a></em> by Mark Pilgrim is a good place to start.

<h2>Color Palette</h2>

<em>Go Mobile First</em> uses a simple, muted color palette. Colors were chosen for their high-contrast and accessibility for color blind individuals.

Feel free to customize as you see fit (you might want to use the free <a href="http://colororacle.org/">Color Oracle app</a> to check for accessibility).

<ul class="unstyled">
<li>Link Blue: <span style="color: #0088cc;">#0088cc</span></li>
<li>Button Hover Blue: <span style="color: #005580;">#005580</span></li>
<li>Dark Gray: #272727</li>
<li>Muted Gray: <span style="color: #808080;">#808080</span></li>
<li>Gray Lines & Borders: <span style="color: #e5e5e5;">#e5e5e5</span></li>
</ul>

<h2>Typography</h2>

<em>Go Mobile First</em> uses a sans-serif font stack: "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif.

I put a lot of effort into the typographic scale for the site. (You can read more about that process in <a href="https://gomakethings.com/typography-first-web-design/">Typography First Web Design</a>.) It was built using Chris Pearson's <a href="http://www.pearsonified.com/typography/">Golden Ratio Typography Calculator</a> and Iain (not a typo) Lamb's <a href="http://lamb.cc/typograph/">Typograph app</a>.

<strong>The Scale:</strong> 14px, 15px, 17px (base), 20px, 23px, 26px, 30px, 34px, 51px, 68px, 85px, 102px.
