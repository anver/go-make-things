## Short Description

Front end development has gotten a lot more complicated. Preprocessors, package managers, command line tools, CSS-in-JS, the never-ending stream of JS Frameworks... it's exhausting.

But there's a simpler way! Learn how to build engaging, modern websites and web apps without all of the bloat.

## Full Description

Over the last couple of years, front end development has gotten a lot more complicated. Preprocessors, module loaders, package managers, ES6, command line tools, single page apps, CSS-in-JS, Angular, React, Vue, Cosmic (I made that last one up, but it sounds legit, right?).

It's exhausting. It makes building for the web harder. It makes the sites and apps we build slower and more fragile. It often makes the web worse.

In this talk, I'll teach you a simpler approach to front end development: the lean web. You'll learn how to build modern, engaging websites and web apps without all of the cruft. All you need is a web browser and text editor.
