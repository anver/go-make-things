## Full Description

I wanted to better understand how today's popular frameworks work under the hood, and see if there was a way to achieve the same thing with a smaller footprint. So, I built my own alternative to Vue.

In this talk, I share what I did, how it all works, and what I learned along the way. I explore topics like: whether or not reactivity is actually a best practice; why you can't just replace React or Vue with `innerHTML`; the tradeoffs frameworks introduce into your development process; and whether or not it was a good idea to do this.
