	<h1><span class="title">How to go from idea to published book in a week</span></h1>
	

	

<p>Two weeks ago, I released <em><a href="/career-guide/">The Web Developer Career Guide</a></em>, my field guide on how to stay relevant, hack the hiring process, and make more money as an in‑house developer.</p>

<p>I went from idea to published book in about a week, and today I want to walk you through how I did it.</p>

<h2 id="planning-the-book">Planning the book</h2>

<p>Like everything I do (code included), <em>The Web Developer Career Guide</em> started out on actual paper.</p>

<p>I made a rough list of high-level topics I wanted to cover and the the things I needed to address under each of them. Some topics were based on my previous experience coaching developers on careers. Others were based on emails I&rsquo;d gotten from readers of <a href="/newsletter">my newsletter</a>.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t worry too much about structure and order at this point. I just wanted to capture all of the things I needed to write about.</p>

<h2 id="writing-the-book">Writing the book</h2>

<p>I cheated, and you should, too.</p>

<p>I pulled about a third of the book content from previous articles I&rsquo;ve written, email responses I sent to newsletter readers, and so on. I did some light editing on those, but why reinvent the wheel? This is the same approach I used for <em><a href="/wicked-fast-websites">Wicked Fast Websites</a></em>.</p>

<p>For all of the stuff left to be written, I opened up my text editor (I like Sublime Text) and just started writing in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">markdown</a>.</p>

<p>Picking a topic I knew well and was ready to write about helped a lot. There was minimal research involved. I just put everything taht was already in my head down into pixels.</p>

<h2 id="organizing-the-book">Organizing the book</h2>

<p>After getting everything out into markdown, I started to organize stuff into a logical order.</p>

<p>What would someone need to know first before this other piece of info makes sense? How would they approach a task? What would they need to do first? Let&rsquo;s talk about that first.</p>

<p>I reordered my markdown files just by renaming them with a numbered prefix: <code>01</code>, <code>02</code>, etc.</p>

<h2 id="editing-the-book">Editing the book</h2>

<p>I edited the book myself, which can be tough. Your brain tends to ignore typos or incorrect words because it knows what you meant to write and doesn&rsquo;t even notice when it says something different.</p>

<p>To get around this, I created a Kindle version of the book from my markdown files (more on this later) and sent it to myself by email.</p>

<p>Reading the book on a different device in a different medium forced me to notice all sorts of things I&rsquo;d messed up. I used the Kindle notes feature to collect of my changes. When I was done reading the whole thing, I pulled up my list of notes and made all of my updates.</p>

<h2 id="creating-the-book">Creating the book</h2>

<p>I used <a href="http://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> to create PDF and EPUB versions of the book from my markdown files, and <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a> to convert it to Kindle&rsquo;s MOBI format.</p>

<p>Both of these are 100% free, but do require you to be comfortable working in command line.</p>

<p>Setting Pandoc up to look the way I wanted took a bunch of trial and error. To make things easier for you (and me next time I do this), I <a href="https://github.com/cferdinandi/ebook-boilerplate">open sourced my ebook boilerplate</a>.</p>

<h3 id="setting-book-info">Setting book info</h3>

<p>Pandoc uses a <code>metadata.yml</code> file to set the title, subtitle, author name, and so on, and embeds all of that into the EPUB. It also autogenerates a title page for you.</p>

<p>PDFs don&rsquo;t use this file, so I also created a <code>title.md</code> file that contains all of that stuff. I only include it with the PDF version.</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-cover">Creating a cover</h3>

<p>I created a simple cover in Keynote (in the past, I&rsquo;ve used PowerPoint). I set up my Keynote to have a custom 1100 x 850 pixel size, so that it would generate files I could scale to 8.5 x 11, the size of my PDF.</p>

<p>I exported the cover to PNG file, which I link to in the <code>metadata.yml</code> file for EPUB and MOBI formats.</p>

<p>Pandoc can&rsquo;t create a full-bleed cover image. You have two options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Just include the image in the <code>title.md</code> file and be ok with white margins.</li>
<li>Create a standalone PDF and merge it with the ebook.</li>
</ol>

<p>I chose option 2. Easy to do on OSX in Preview (just drag and drop thumbnails), and there are free tools to do this in Windows as well.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>I create some &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; covers for this project, but you want want to hire someone to create a professional cover for you.</em></p>

<h2 id="distributing-the-book">Distributing the book</h2>

<p>I decided to use <a href="https://easydigitaldownloads.com/">Easy Digital Downloads</a> to sell the book directly through my site.</p>

<p>I had toyed with using something like <a href="https://www.sendowl.com/">SendOwl</a> or <a href="https://gumroad.com/">GumRoad</a>, but ultimately decided I wanted more control and flexibility over things.</p>

<p>Easy Digital Downloads is awesome and super extensible if you&rsquo;re comfortable working with PHP and WordPress. I&rsquo;ll be covering all of my integrations and customizations for this in another article.</p>

<h2 id="marketing-the-book">Marketing the book</h2>

<p>This is always the biggest struggle for me.</p>

<p>I sent out a few emails to my newsletter telling them about the book before it launched, and then again after. Since they&rsquo;re the awesomest people on the planet, I gave them some serious money off: 50% for everyone, and 100% off for people who wanted to be book evangelists (both good for just 48 hours).</p>

<p>I also mentioned the book on Twitter a few times, and am now reaching out to some podcasts to talk about careers for web developers.</p>

<p>Three articles you should definitely read on this:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://pjrvs.com/a/selfpub/">Marketing tools for any self-published book</a></li>
<li><a href="http://nathanbarry.com/behind-the-scenes/">$26,679 in 24 hours: stats from my latest book launch</a></li>
<li><a href="http://nathanbarry.com/learned-selling-6000-ebook-today/">What I learned selling $6,000+ of my ebook today</a></li>
</ol>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that my numbers are <strong>nowhere</strong> near that impressive. I sold about $250 worth in the first week.</p>

<p>But, I also have a much smaller newsletter list and audience in general. I&rsquo;m hoping to slowly sell more over time, rather than having a bit spike in sales that trickles off to nothing.</p>
