The first is the element to render your template into, either as a selector string or the actual node itself. The second is an object with your template, and optionally, your data/or state.\\nThe template can be a simple string, or a function that returns a string. If a function is used, your data or state is passed in as an argument. For a more JSX/React-like experience, you can use template literals.\\n\\u0026lt;div id=\\u0026#34;app\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt;// Setup the component var app = new Reef(\\u0026#39;#app\\u0026#39;, { data: { time: new Date().toLocaleTimeString() }, template: function (props) { return \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;strong\\u0026gt;The time is:\\u0026lt;/strong\\u0026gt; \\u0026#39; + props.time; } }); // Render the component app.render(); // Update the clock once a second window.setInterval(function () { app.data.time = new Date().toLocaleTimeString(); app.render(); }, 1000);  Dig into the full documentation on GitHub.\\nThe foundation Note: Reef is an improved version of the state-based component helper function I wrote about a couple of weeks ago. If you read that article, a lot of this will seem familiar.\\nFirst, I setup a UMD wrapper. Never heard of UMD?\\n If you want your plugin to work with RequireJS, Node, or Browserify, you should use a Universal Module Definition (UMD) pattern. This wrapper for your plugin provides support for AMD and CommonJS modules, as well as global variables (like you would use with a revealing module pattern).\\n Here\\u0026rsquo;s what that looks like.\\n(function (root, factory) { if (typeof define === \\u0026#39;function\\u0026#39; \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; define.amd) { define([], function () { return factory(root); }); } else if (typeof exports === \\u0026#39;object\\u0026#39;) { module.exports = factory(root); } else { root.Reef = factory(root); } })(typeof global !== \\u0026#39;undefined\\u0026#39; ? global : typeof window !== \\u0026#39;undefined\\u0026#39; ? window : this, function (window) { \\u0026#39;use strict\\u0026#39;; // My code will go here...  });  Next, I created a component object that holds all of the properties (the element, the state/data, and the template) for a component.\\nFirst, I make sure DOMParser is supported. We\\u0026rsquo;ll talk about this more later, but its what allows us to securely turn strings into DOM elements. Then, I make sure that an elem argument and an options.template property were provided. Without either of them, Reef is useless.\\nAssuming all is good, I set the elem, template, and data (if provided) as properties of the Component. Then, I return it.\\n(function (root, factory) { if (typeof define === \\u0026#39;function\\u0026#39; \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; define.amd) { define([], function () { return factory(root); }); } else if (typeof exports === \\u0026#39;object\\u0026#39;) { module.exports = factory(root); } else { root.Reef = factory(root); } })(typeof global !== \\u0026#39;undefined\\u0026#39; ? global : typeof window !== \\u0026#39;undefined\\u0026#39; ? window : this, function (window) { \\u0026#39;use strict\\u0026#39;; /** * Create the Component object * @param {String|Node} elem The element to make into a component * @param {Object} options The component options */ var Component = function (elem, options) { // Check browser support \\tif (!(\\u0026#39;DOMParser\\u0026#39; in window)) throw \\u0026#39;Reef.js is not supported by this browser.\\u0026#39;; // Make sure an element is provided \\tif (!elem) throw \\u0026#39;Reef.js: You did not provide an element to make into a component.\\u0026#39;; // Make sure a template is provided \\tif (!options || !options.template) throw \\u0026#39;Reef.js: You did not provide a template for this component.\\u0026#39;; // Set the component properties \\tthis.elem = elem; this.data = options.data; this.template = options.template; }; return Component; });  We\\u0026rsquo;ve now got enough code in place that we can use the new Reef() method. It won\\u0026rsquo;t do anything, but it won\\u0026rsquo;t throw errors, either.\\nvar myApp = new Reef(\\u0026#39;#my-app\\u0026#39;, { data: [], template: \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39; });  Rendering the DOM Now that we\\u0026rsquo;ve got our stateful component set up, we can use the template, and optionally the data, to create HTML and inject it into the DOM.\\nIn my original series on stateful components, I used innerHTML to do this. It\\u0026rsquo;s simple and it works, but it leaves you exposed to cross-site scripting attacks.\\nTo work around this, I included a helper method to sanitize third-party data. It works, but it requires developer discipline to work properly. You need to remember to use it and do so proactively.\\nOne nice thing about Vue and React is that they handle this for you, and I wanted Reef to do that, too. This roughly doubled the size of the function, from 0.7kb to 1.5kb. Not a bad tradeoff for better out-of-the-box security!\\nLet\\u0026rsquo;s look at how that works.\\nThe .render() method I added a .render() method to the Component.prototype.\\nFirst up: some checks and tests to make sure we have everything we need. The method does is double-check that DOMParser is supported and that a template exists.\\nThen, if the elem property is a string, it uses querySelector() to find it. Otherwise, it uses the provided DOM node. If the element doesn\\u0026rsquo;t exist, it throws an error.\\nFinally, if the template property is a function, it runs it to get the template. Otherwise, it uses it outright. If the template is not a string or number, Reef throws an error.\\n/** * Render a template into the DOM * @return {Node} The element */ Component.prototype.render = function () { // Check browser support \\tif (!(\\u0026#39;DOMParser\\u0026#39; in window)) throw \\u0026#39;Reef.js is not supported by this browser.\\u0026#39;; // Make sure there\\u0026#39;s a template \\tif (!this.template) throw \\u0026#39;Reef.js: No template was provided.\\u0026#39;; // If elem is an element, use it. \\t// If it\\u0026#39;s a selector, get it. \\tvar elem = typeof this.elem === \\u0026#39;string\\u0026#39; ? document.querySelector(this.elem) : this.elem; if (!elem) throw \\u0026#39;Reef.js: The DOM element to render your template into was not found.\\u0026#39;; // Get the template \\tvar template = (typeof this.template === \\u0026#39;function\\u0026#39; ? this.template(this.data) : this.template); if ([\\u0026#39;string\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;number\\u0026#39;].indexOf(typeof template) === -1) return; };  Injecting the template into the DOM This is where we deviate from some of my older tutorials.\\nI pass my template string into a stringToHTML() method that converts it into actual DOM elements that can be parsed. Then, I pass that result into another helper method called createDOMMap(). This creates a nested array of the elements in the DOM tree for the template.\\n/** * Render a template into the DOM * @return {Node} The element */ Component.prototype.render = function () { // Check browser support \\tif (!(\\u0026#39;DOMParser\\u0026#39; in window)) throw \\u0026#39;Reef.js is not supported by this browser.\\u0026#39;; // Make sure there\\u0026#39;s a template \\tif (!this.template) throw \\u0026#39;Reef.js: No template was provided.\\u0026#39;; // If elem is an element, use it. \\t// If it\\u0026#39;s a selector, get it. \\tvar elem = typeof this.elem === \\u0026#39;string\\u0026#39; ? document.querySelector(this.elem) : this.elem; if (!elem) throw \\u0026#39;Reef.js: The DOM element to render your template into was not found.\\u0026#39;; // Get the template \\tvar template = (typeof this.template === \\u0026#39;function\\u0026#39; ? this.template(this.data) : this.template); if ([\\u0026#39;string\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;number\\u0026#39;].indexOf(typeof template) === -1) return; // Create DOM maps of the template and target element \\t// var templateMap = sanitize(template); \\tvar templateMap = createDOMMap(stringToHTML(template)); };  It looks something like this:\\n[ { content: \\u0026#39;Hello world\\u0026#39;, atts: [ { att: \\u0026#39;class\\u0026#39;, value: \\u0026#39;hero-text\\u0026#39; }, { att: \\u0026#39;data-name\\u0026#39;, value: \\u0026#39;world\\u0026#39; } ], type: \\u0026#39;h1\\u0026#39;, children: [], node: h1 // this is the actual Node itself \\t}, { content: null, atts: [], type: \\u0026#39;div\\u0026#39;, children: [ // An array like this one, with all of the elements inside the div \\t{ content: \\u0026#39;In this chapter...\\u0026#39;, atts: [], type: \\u0026#39;h2\\u0026#39;, children: [], node: h2 // this is the actual Node itself \\t}, // ... \\t], node: div } ]  I do the same thing with the element we\\u0026rsquo;re going to render the template into.\\nThen, I run them both through a diff() helper function that compares each node in the two DOM tree maps, looks for differences, and only updates the things that have changed.\\nWe\\u0026rsquo;ll look at how that all works in just a few moments.\\n/** * Render a template into the DOM * @return {Node} The element */ Component.prototype.render = function () { // Check browser support \\tif (!(\\u0026#39;DOMParser\\u0026#39; in window)) throw \\u0026#39;Reef.js is not supported by this browser.\\u0026#39;; // Make sure there\\u0026#39;s a template \\tif (!this.template) throw \\u0026#39;Reef.js: No template was provided.\\u0026#39;; // If elem is an element, use it. \\t// If it\\u0026#39;s a selector, get it. \\tvar elem = typeof this.elem === \\u0026#39;string\\u0026#39; ? document.querySelector(this.elem) : this.elem; if (!elem) throw \\u0026#39;Reef.js: The DOM element to render your template into was not found.\\u0026#39;; // Get the template \\tvar template = (typeof this.template === \\u0026#39;function\\u0026#39; ? this.template(this.data) : this.template); if ([\\u0026#39;string\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;number\\u0026#39;].indexOf(typeof template) === -1) return; // Create DOM maps of the template and target element \\t// var templateMap = sanitize(template); \\tvar templateMap = createDOMMap(stringToHTML(template)); var domMap = createDOMMap(elem); // Diff and update the DOM \\tdiff(templateMap, domMap, elem); };  Finally, I emit a custom event, render, on the element that our template was injected into. You can listen for these events with addEventListener().\\ndocument.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;render\\u0026#39;, function (event) { if (event.target.id === \\u0026#39;my-app\\u0026#39;) { console.log(\\u0026#39;My app was rendered!\\u0026#39;); } }, false);  Then, I return the element itself. This isn\\u0026rsquo;t likely to be used often, but I wanted to bake as much flexibility in for use cases I haven\\u0026rsquo;t thought of as I could.\\n/** * Render a template into the DOM * @return {Node} The element */ Component.prototype.render = function () { // Check browser support \\tif (!(\\u0026#39;DOMParser\\u0026#39; in window)) throw \\u0026#39;Reef.js is not supported by this browser.\\u0026#39;; // Make sure there\\u0026#39;s a template \\tif (!this.template) throw \\u0026#39;Reef.js: No template was provided.\\u0026#39;; // If elem is an element, use it. \\t// If it\\u0026#39;s a selector, get it. \\tvar elem = typeof this.elem === \\u0026#39;string\\u0026#39; ? document.querySelector(this.elem) : this.elem; if (!elem) throw \\u0026#39;Reef.js: The DOM element to render your template into was not found.\\u0026#39;; // Get the template \\tvar template = (typeof this.template === \\u0026#39;function\\u0026#39; ? this.template(this.data) : this.template); if ([\\u0026#39;string\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;number\\u0026#39;].indexOf(typeof template) === -1) return; // Create DOM maps of the template and target element \\t// var templateMap = sanitize(template); \\tvar templateMap = createDOMMap(stringToHTML(template)); var domMap = createDOMMap(elem); // Diff and update the DOM \\tdiff(templateMap, domMap, elem); // Dispatch a render event \\tif (typeof window.CustomEvent === \\u0026#39;function\\u0026#39;) { var event = new CustomEvent(\\u0026#39;render\\u0026#39;, { bubbles: true }); elem.dispatchEvent(event); } // Return the elem for use elsewhere \\treturn elem; };  Converting a string into HTML A simple way to convert a string to HTML is to do something like this.\\nvar template = \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;h1\\u0026gt;Hello world!\\u0026lt;/h1\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39; + \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;div\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39; + \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;h2\\u0026gt;This article contains...\\u0026lt;/h2\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39; + \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39;; var tempDiv = document.createElement(\\u0026#39;div\\u0026#39;); tempDiv.innerHTML = template;  However\\u0026hellip; even if you don\\u0026rsquo;t render your tempDiv into the DOM, it will still execute things like onerror properties that can be used to run cross-site scripting attacks.\\nAfter a bunch of Googling, I discovered DOMParser(), a browser API that let\\u0026rsquo;s you create DOM nodes from a string without executing them. It works in all modern browsers, and IE9 and up. Perfect!\\nIt creates an entire HTML document (with a headder, body and so on). In my stringToHTML() method, I pass in my string and return the document body. It has the template as actual HTML elements from our template.\\n/** * Convert a template string into HTML DOM nodes * @param {String} str The template string * @return {Node} The template HTML */ var stringToHTML = function (str) { var parser = new DOMParser(); var doc = parser.parseFromString(str, \\u0026#39;text/html\\u0026#39;); return doc.body; };  Creating a map of DOM nodes Now that we\\u0026rsquo;ve converted our string into HTML elements, we can map them into an array with the createDOMMap() helper method.\\nIn this method, I created a map array that will hold all of the data about our DOM tree.\\nI used the .childNodes property to get all of the direct descendant HTML nodes inside our element. You could also use the .children, but it excludes text nodes that are not wrapper in HTML elements.\\n\\u0026lt;h1\\u0026gt;This would get included\\u0026lt;/h1\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;This would, too!\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt; But this would not... Then, I pass it through Array.from() to create an array from the NodesList that it returns, and use the forEach() method to loop through each item.\\n/** * Create a DOM Tree Map for an element * @param {Node} element The element to map * @return {Array} A DOM tree map */ var createDOMMap = function (element) { var map = []; Array.from(element.childNodes).forEach(function (node) { // Do something... \\t}); };  In the forEach() loop, I push an object into the map array, with the following properties:\\n content - The .textContent of the node, or null if the node has other nodes in it. atts - The attributes on the element. This is created by passing the .attributes property value into a getAttributes() helper that we\\u0026rsquo;ll look at in a bit. type - the .tagName (h1, div, etc.). If the element is a text node (nodeType === 3), it doesn\\u0026rsquo;t have a .tagName property so we\\u0026rsquo;ll use text instead. children - A map of the child nodes for the element. I create this by recursively passing the current node into createDOMMap(). node - The actual HTML element itself.  /** * Create a DOM Tree Map for an element * @param {Node} element The element to map * @return {Array} A DOM tree map */ var createDOMMap = function (element) { var map = []; Array.from(element.childNodes).forEach(function (node) { map.push({ content: node.childNodes \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; node.childNodes.length \\u0026gt; 0 ? null : node.textContent, atts: node.nodeType === 3 ? [] : getAttributes(node.attributes), type: node.nodeType === 3 ? \\u0026#39;text\\u0026#39; : node.tagName.toLowerCase(), children: createDOMMap(node), node: node }); }); return map; };  Getting the attributes on a DOM node The .attributes property is a list NamedNodeMap of all of the properties and attributes on an element. It contains a ton of info, and since it\\u0026rsquo;s not an array, isn\\u0026rsquo;t ideal to work with.\\nI used Array.from() to create an array from it, then used the map() method to create a new array with just the attribute name and it\\u0026rsquo;s value.\\n/** * Create an array of the attributes on an element * @param {NamedNodeMap} attributes The attributes on an element * @return {Array} The attributes on an element as an array of key/value pairs */ var getAttributes = function (attributes) { return Array.from(attributes).map(function (attribute) { return { att: attribute.name, value: attribute.value }; }); };  Diffing DOM Maps The hardest part of this project was, by far, creating the function to identify differences between the templateMap and the existing domMap, and make only the needed updates.\\nWhy do this versus just wipe out and start over?\\nThe two big ones:\\n It\\u0026rsquo;s better for performance. It preserves as much of the DOM state as possible, so you don\\u0026rsquo;t, for example, lose focus on a form field you\\u0026rsquo;re actively typing into (imagine an app that shows you a preview in real time as you type).  First, I calculated the difference in length between the existing domMap and the templateMap. If the domMap has more elements, I loop through it in reverse and remove items until they\\u0026rsquo;re the same length.\\nThen, I can loop through each item in my templateMap and compare it to the corresponding item in the domMap.\\n/** * Diff the existing DOM node versus the template * @param {Array} templateMap A DOM tree map of the template content * @param {Array} domMap A DOM tree map of the existing DOM node * @param {Node} elem The element to render content into */ var diff = function (templateMap, domMap, elem) { // If extra elements in domMap, remove them \\tvar count = domMap.length - templateMap.length; if (count \\u0026gt; 0) { for (; count \\u0026gt; 0; count--) { domMap[domMap.length - count].node.remove(); } } // Diff each item in the templateMap \\ttemplateMap.forEach(function (node, index) { // Compare \\t}); };  If the item in my templateMap doesn\\u0026rsquo;t exist at all in the domMap, I\\u0026rsquo;ll create a new DOM element using a makeElem() helper function (more on how that works in a bit). Then I\\u0026rsquo;ll append it to the parent element with the appendChild() method.\\nIf the item exists, but they\\u0026rsquo;re not the same type, I\\u0026rsquo;ll use makeElem() to create a new method, and the replaceChild() method to replace it in the DOM.\\n/** * Diff the existing DOM node versus the template * @param {Array} templateMap A DOM tree map of the template content * @param {Array} domMap A DOM tree map of the existing DOM node * @param {Node} elem The element to render content into */ var diff = function (templateMap, domMap, elem) { // If extra elements in domMap, remove them \\tvar count = domMap.length - templateMap.length; if (count \\u0026gt; 0) { for (; count \\u0026gt; 0; count--) { domMap[domMap.length - count].node.remove(); } } // Diff each item in the templateMap \\ttemplateMap.forEach(function (node, index) { // If element doesn\\u0026#39;t exist, create it \\tif (!domMap[index]) { elem.appendChild(makeElem(templateMap[index])); return; } // If element is not the same type, replace it with new element \\tif (templateMap[index].type !== domMap[index].type) { domMap[index].node.parentNode.replaceChild(makeElem(templateMap[index]), domMap[index].node); return; } }); };  That takes care of creating new elements, but what about elements where only the content or some attributes have changed?\\nI created a helper method, diffAtts(), to check for differences in attributes and update them accordingly. We\\u0026rsquo;ll look at that shortly, too.\\nIf the content properties don\\u0026rsquo;t match, I use textContent to update the content in the DOM.\\nAnd if the item has child elements, I pass it recursively into the diff() method so that it can repeat the process.\\n/** * Diff the existing DOM node versus the template * @param {Array} templateMap A DOM tree map of the template content * @param {Array} domMap A DOM tree map of the existing DOM node * @param {Node} elem The element to render content into */ var diff = function (templateMap, domMap, elem) { // If extra elements in domMap, remove them \\tvar count = domMap.length - templateMap.length; if (count \\u0026gt; 0) { for (; count \\u0026gt; 0; count--) { domMap[domMap.length - count].node.remove(); } } // Diff each item in the templateMap \\ttemplateMap.forEach(function (node, index) { // If element doesn\\u0026#39;t exist, create it \\tif (!domMap[index]) { elem.appendChild(makeElem(templateMap[index])); return; } // If element is not the same type, replace it with new element \\tif (templateMap[index].type !== domMap[index].type) { domMap[index].node.parentNode.replaceChild(makeElem(templateMap[index]), domMap[index].node); return; } // If attributes are different, update them \\tdiffAtts(templateMap[index], domMap[index], domMap[index].node); // If content is different, update it \\tif (templateMap[index].content !== domMap[index].content) { domMap[index].node.textContent = templateMap[index].content; } // Repeat for child elements \\tif (node.children.length \\u0026gt; 0) { diff(node.children, domMap[index].children || [], domMap[index].node); } }); };  Diffing attributes Finding the differences between attributes was a bit more involved that I had expected.\\nFirst, I need to find attributes that are currently in the DOM but aren\\u0026rsquo;t in the new template.\\nTo do that, I pass the existing attributes into the Array.filter() method. In the callback, I use the Array.find() method to look the existing attribute in the new attributes array. If it\\u0026rsquo;s undefined, I return the item to the filter() array as one to be removed.\\n/** * Diff the attributes on an existing element versus the template * @param {Object} template The new template * @param {Object} existing The existing DOM node */ var diffAtts = function (template, existing) { // Get attributes to remove \\tvar remove = existing.atts.filter(function (att) { var getAtt = template.atts.find(function (newAtt) { return att.att === newAtt.att; }); return getAtt === undefined; }); };  Next, I need to find existing attributes that need to be updated and new ones to be added.\\nI again use Array.filter(), this time with the new template attributes. Again, inside the callback, I use Array.find(), this time looking to see if the new attribute is already in the DOM.\\nIf it\\u0026rsquo;s undefined, or if the values don\\u0026rsquo;t match, I return it to the new array as an item to get added/updated.\\n/** * Diff the attributes on an existing element versus the template * @param {Object} template The new template * @param {Object} existing The existing DOM node */ var diffAtts = function (template, existing) { // Get attributes to remove \\tvar remove = existing.atts.filter(function (att) { var getAtt = template.atts.find(function (newAtt) { return att.att === newAtt.att; }); return getAtt === undefined; }); // Get attributes to change \\tvar change = template.atts.filter(function (att) { var getAtt = existing.atts.find(function (existingAtt) { return att.att === existingAtt.att; }); return getAtt === undefined || getAtt.value !== att.value; }); };  Then, I pass the change array into and addAttributes(), and the remove array into the removeAttributes() array\\n/** * Diff the attributes on an existing element versus the template * @param {Object} template The new template * @param {Object} existing The existing DOM node */ var diffAtts = function (template, existing) { // Get attributes to remove \\tvar remove = existing.atts.filter(function (att) { var getAtt = template.atts.find(function (newAtt) { return att.att === newAtt.att; }); return getAtt === undefined; }); // Get attributes to change \\tvar change = template.atts.filter(function (att) { var getAtt = existing.atts.find(function (existingAtt) { return att.att === existingAtt.att; }); return getAtt === undefined || getAtt.value !== att.value; }); // Add/remove any required attributes \\taddAttributes(existing.node, change); removeAttributes(existing.node, remove); };  Adding attributes I loop through each attribute in the array using the Array.forEach() method.\\nIf the attribute type is class, I use className to set/update it. If the attribute name starts with data- (as in, it\\u0026rsquo;s a data attribute), I use setAttribute() to add it.\\nOtherwise, I set it as a property directly on the element.\\nWhy not just use setAttribute() for everything? It would set things like onerror, opening you up to, again cross-site scripting. This approach is more secure.\\n/** * Add attributes to an element * @param {Node} elem The element * @param {Array} atts The attributes to add */ var addAttributes = function (elem, atts) { atts.forEach(function (attribute) { // If the attribute is a class, use className \\t// Else if it starts with `data-`, use setAttribute() \\t// Otherwise, set is as a property of the element \\tif (attribute.att === \\u0026#39;class\\u0026#39;) { elem.className = attribute.value; } else if (attribute.att.slice(0, 5) === \\u0026#39;data-\\u0026#39;) { elem.setAttribute(attribute.att, attribute.value || \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;); } else { elem[attribute.att] = attribute.value || \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;; } }); };  Removing attributes I loop through each attribute using the Array.forEach() method.\\nIf the attribute type is class, I use className to wipe it out. Otherwise, I use removeAttribute() to remove it.\\n/** * Remove attributes from an element * @param {Node} elem The element * @param {Array} atts The attributes to remove */ var removeAttributes = function (elem, atts) { atts.forEach(function (attribute) { // If the attribute is a class, use className \\t// Otherwise, use removeAttribute() \\tif (attribute.att === \\u0026#39;class\\u0026#39;) { elem.className = \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;; } else { elem.removeAttribute(attribute.att); } }); };  Creating Elements Finally, let\\u0026rsquo;s look at the makeElem() helper method and how I create the actual elements to inject into the DOM.\\nIf the element type property is text, I use document.createTextNode() to create the node. Otherwise, I use document.createElement().\\nThen, I pass the new node and it\\u0026rsquo;s atts property into the addAttributes() helper function to add all of the attributes.\\nIf the element has child nodes, I loop through each one with Array.forEach(), and recursively pass it into makeElem() and append it to the element.\\nOtherwise, if it\\u0026rsquo;s not a text node, I set the content with the .textContent property. Then, I return the node.\\n/** * Make an HTML element * @param {Object} elem The element details * @return {Node} The HTML element */ var makeElem = function (elem) { // Create the element \\tvar node = elem.type === \\u0026#39;text\\u0026#39; ? document.createTextNode(elem.content) : document.createElement(elem.type); // Add attributes \\taddAttributes(node, elem.atts); // If the element has child nodes, create them \\t// Otherwise, add textContent \\tif (elem.children.length \\u0026gt; 0) { elem.children.forEach(function (childElem) { node.appendChild(makeElem(childElem)); }); } else if (elem.type !== \\u0026#39;text\\u0026#39;) { node.textContent = elem.content; } return node; };  Ensuring browser compatibility Reef.js works in all modern browsers, and IE9 and up.\\nIt does use some newer ES6 methods, though. So do I make sure it works across a wide range of browsers?\\nPolyfills.\\nMany of the included methods work in IE9 and above already\\u0026mdash;Array.forEach(), for example. For those that don\\u0026rsquo;t\\u0026mdash;Array.find(), Array.from(), and Element.remove()\\u0026mdash;I included polyfills.\\n(There\\u0026rsquo;s also a non-polyfilled version for people who already include their own.)\\nWrapping Up Amazingly, the core Reef.js file is only 267 lines long, including lots of whitespace and in-code documentation. The polyfills add 150 lines (and 4kb before minifying and gzipping).\\nIn the process of creating Reef, I learned a lot about the sheer engineering effort that goes into writing robust frameworks like Vue and React. So much respect for the developers who built those tools, even if I don\\u0026rsquo;t prefer to use them myself.\\nI had originally looked into adding Reactivity: having the UI automatically re-render whenever the data is updated. After reading up on how that works, though, I decided it wasn\\u0026rsquo;t worth the extra bytes.\\nI\\u0026rsquo;m most proud of how little Reef actually does.\\nI believe the best* tools are the ones that do as little as possible.

I don\\u0026rsquo;t want to use weird custom DOM attributes.\\nI just want to write clean markup, simple JavaScript, and build cool stuff.\\nReef does less. That\\u0026rsquo;s a good thing. Reef is an anti-framework. It does a lot less than the big guys like React and Vue.\\n It doesn\\u0026rsquo;t have a Virtual DOM. It doesn\\u0026rsquo;t automagically update the UI when state changes. It doesn\\u0026rsquo;t provide a bunch of custom methods.

Now we can setup our stopwatch component.\\nCreating the Component We\\u0026rsquo;ll create a setup() function where we\\u0026rsquo;ll setup our component and render it for the first time.\\n/** * Setup the stopwatch on page load */ var setup = function () { // Setup our component }; // Setup the app setup();  Let\\u0026rsquo;s create a global stopwatch variable that we assign our component to, so that we can access it from other areas of the script.\\nWe\\u0026rsquo;re going to add two pieces of data, or state, to our component. The time property will hold the current time on the timer, and the running property is a boolean that we\\u0026rsquo;ll indicate if the timer is actively running or not.\\nvar stopwatch /** * Setup the stopwatch on page load */ var setup = function () { // Create the stopwatch \\tstopwatch = new Component(\\u0026#39;#app\\u0026#39;, { data: { time: 0, running: false } }); };  Now let\\u0026rsquo;s add a template.\\nWe\\u0026rsquo;ll include a section with the ID of #stopwatch that holds the actual stopwatch timer, and another section with buttons to control the stopwatch.\\nEach control button will have a [data-stopwatch] attribute we can use later to determine what to do when it\\u0026rsquo;s clicked.\\nThe first button will display \\u0026ldquo;Start\\u0026rdquo; when running is set to false, and have an action of start. When running is true, it will say \\u0026ldquo;Stop\\u0026rdquo; (and have an action of stop, too).\\nThe second button will say \\u0026ldquo;Reset,\\u0026rdquo; and have an action of reset as well.\\n/** * Setup the stopwatch on page load */ var setup = function () { // Create the stopwatch \\tstopwatch = new Component(\\u0026#39;#app\\u0026#39;, { data: { time: 0, running: false }, template: function (props) { var template = \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;div id=\\u0026#34;stopwatch\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39; + props.time + \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39; + \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39; + \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;button data-stopwatch=\\u0026#34;\\u0026#39; + (props.running ? \\u0026#39;stop\\u0026#39; : \\u0026#39;start\\u0026#39;) + \\u0026#39;\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39; + (props.running ? \\u0026#39;Stop\\u0026#39; : \\u0026#39;Start\\u0026#39;) + \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;/button\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39; + \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;button data-stopwatch=\\u0026#34;reset\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;Reset\\u0026lt;/button\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39; + \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39;; return template; } }); // Render the stopwatch into the DOM \\tstopwatch.render(); };  Running the timer Now we need a way to start, stop, and reset the timer. Let\\u0026rsquo;s setup an event listener to detect clicks in the DOM, and pass in a clickHandler() callback function.\\ndocument.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;click\\u0026#39;, clickHandler, false);  This approach uses event delegation, and allows us to listen to all clicks in the DOM and filter out only the ones we need. It\\u0026rsquo;s better for performance, and means we don\\u0026rsquo;t have to reattach event listeners to specific elements every time the DOM updates.\\nWe\\u0026rsquo;ll check if the event.target, the element clicked, has the [data-stopwatch] attribute using the getAttribute() method. If it doesn\\u0026rsquo;t, we\\u0026rsquo;ll bail.\\nNext, we\\u0026rsquo;ll check to see what the action is. If it\\u0026rsquo;s start, we\\u0026rsquo;ll run a start() helper method, if it\\u0026rsquo;s stop, we\\u0026rsquo;ll run a stop() helper method, and if it\\u0026rsquo;s reset, we\\u0026rsquo;ll run a reset() helper method.\\n/** * Handle click events */ var clickHandler = function (event) { // Check if a stopwatch action button was clicked \\tvar action = event.target.getAttribute(\\u0026#39;data-stopwatch\\u0026#39;); if (!action) return; // If it\\u0026#39;s the start button, start \\tif (action === \\u0026#39;start\\u0026#39;) { start(); return; } // If it\\u0026#39;s the stop button, stop \\tif (action === \\u0026#39;stop\\u0026#39;) { stop(); return; } // If it\\u0026#39;s the stopwatch button, reset \\tif (action === \\u0026#39;reset\\u0026#39;) { reset(); } };  Starting the Stopwatch In the start() helper function, the first thing we\\u0026rsquo;ll do is update the state to change stopwatch.data.runnung to true. Then we\\u0026rsquo;ll render a fresh copy of the UI.\\n/** * Start the stopwatch */ var start = function () { // Render immediately \\tstopwatch.data.running = true; stopwatch.render(); };  Our stopwatch counts in seconds, so we\\u0026rsquo;ll want to tick it up once a second.\\nWe\\u0026rsquo;ll use the setInterval() method to run a callback method every 1000 milliseconds (or 1 second). In that callback, we\\u0026rsquo;ll update the stopwatch.data.time state by adding 1 to it to increase the time by a second.\\nThen we\\u0026rsquo;ll call stopwatch.render() to update the UI.\\nEventually we\\u0026rsquo;ll need to stop the timer from running, so we\\u0026rsquo;ll assign it to a global variable, timer, that we can use to cancel the setInterval() later.\\nvar stopwatch, timer; /** * Start the stopwatch */ var start = function () { // Render immediately \\tstopwatch.data.running = true; stopwatch.render(); // Start the timer \\ttimer = window.setInterval(function () { // Update the timer \\tstopwatch.data.time = stopwatch.data.time + 1; stopwatch.render(); }, 1000); };  Stopping the Stopwatch In the stop() helper method, we\\u0026rsquo;ll first set the stopwatch.data.running state to false.\\nWe can stop our setInterval() callback from running by passing it into the clearInterval() method. This only works when the interval has been assigned to a named variable.\\nThen, we\\u0026rsquo;ll run stopwatch.render() to update the UI.\\n/** * Stop the stopwatch */ var stop = function () { stopwatch.data.running = false; window.clearInterval(timer); stopwatch.render(); };  Resetting the Stopwatch In the reset() helper method, we\\u0026rsquo;ll update the stopwatch.data.time state back to 0, and run the stop() helper function to stop the timer.\\n/** * Reset the stopwatch */ var reset = function () { stopwatch.data.time = 0; stop(); };  Formatting the Time At this point, we have a working stopwatch. Cool!\\nHere\\u0026rsquo;s a demo.\\n But\\u0026hellip; it only shows time in seconds. After 60 seconds, you ideally want the time to show up as minutes and seconds. And after 60 minutes, you ideally want to show hours, too.\\nLet\\u0026rsquo;s add a formatTime() helper method to make the time more visually pleasing and useful.\\n/** * Format the time in seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds * @param {Number} time The time in seconds * @return {String} The time in hours, minutes, and seconds */ var formatTime = function (time) { // Format the time }; /** * Setup the stopwatch on page load */ var setup = function () { // Create the stopwatch \\tstopwatch = new Component(\\u0026#39;#app\\u0026#39;, { data: { time: 0, running: false }, template: function (props) { var template = \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;div id=\\u0026#34;stopwatch\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39; + formatTime(props.time) + \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39; + \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39; + \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;button data-stopwatch=\\u0026#34;\\u0026#39; + (props.running ? \\u0026#39;stop\\u0026#39; : \\u0026#39;start\\u0026#39;) + \\u0026#39;\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39; + (props.running ? \\u0026#39;Stop\\u0026#39; : \\u0026#39;Start\\u0026#39;) + \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;/button\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39; + \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;button data-stopwatch=\\u0026#34;reset\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;Reset\\u0026lt;/button\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39; + \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39;; return template; } }); // Render the stopwatch into the DOM \\tstopwatch.render(); };  To keeping things simple, let\\u0026rsquo;s display our time like this:\\n1h 12m 23s  To get minutes, we\\u0026rsquo;ll take our time (which is in seconds) and divide it by 60 (the number of seconds in a minute).\\nWe\\u0026rsquo;ll typically get a number with a decimal back (1.23 minutes). We can strip off the decimal places by running it through the parseInt() function.\\n/** * Format the time in seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds * @param {Number} time The time in seconds * @return {String} The time in hours, minutes, and seconds */ var formatTime = function (time) { var minutes = parseInt(time / 60, 10); };  Similarly, to get hours, we\\u0026rsquo;ll divide minutes by 60 (the number of minutes in an hour). We\\u0026rsquo;ll again likely get a decimal, which we can convert into an integer with parseInt().\\nIf the timer has gone into the hours, our minutes will also be greater than 59. We can strip the hours out of our minutes by using the remainder operator (sometimes called the modulo operator). This gives you the remainder after dividing by a number.\\nWe\\u0026rsquo;ll divide by 60 to remove hours.\\n/** * Format the time in seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds * @param {Number} time The time in seconds * @return {String} The time in hours, minutes, and seconds */ var formatTime = function (time) { var minutes = parseInt(time / 60, 10); var hours = parseInt(minutes / 60, 10); if (minutes \\u0026gt; 59) { minutes = minutes % 60; } };  Finally, we can return a formatted string. We\\u0026rsquo;ll use ternary operators to keep this to one line.\\n If hours is greater than 0, we\\u0026rsquo;ll include it plus h. Otherwise, we\\u0026rsquo;ll use an empty string. If minutes is greater than 0, we\\u0026rsquo;ll include it plus m. Otherwise, we\\u0026rsquo;ll use an empty string. No matter what, we\\u0026rsquo;ll include the remainder of time (our time in seconds) divided by 60, with an s at the end.  /** * Format the time in seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds * @param {Number} time The time in seconds * @return {String} The time in hours, minutes, and seconds */ var formatTime = function (time) { var minutes = parseInt(time / 60, 10); var hours = parseInt(minutes / 60, 10); if (minutes \\u0026gt; 59) { minutes = minutes % 60; } return (hours \\u0026gt; 0 ? hours + \\u0026#39;h \\u0026#39; : \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;) + (minutes \\u0026gt; 0 || hours \\u0026gt; 0 ? minutes + \\u0026#39;m \\u0026#39; : \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;) + (time % 60) + \\u0026#39;s\\u0026#39;; };  And here\\u0026rsquo;s a demo of our finished app.\\n \",\"summary\":\"This week, we learned about state and stateful components.

It requires a template property, as either a string or an object that requires a string, to render into the DOM.\\n// Your template can be a string var app1 = new Component(\\u0026#39;#app\\u0026#39;, { template: \\u0026#39;Hello, world!\\u0026#39; }); // It can also be a function that returns a string // Your template can be a string var app2 = new Component(\\u0026#39;#app2\\u0026#39;, { template: function () { return \\u0026#39;Hello, world!\\u0026#39; } });  Adding state to the component As an optional property of the options argument, you can include state for the component with the data property.\\nThe data is automatically passed into your template function, so that you can use it customize the template.\\n// Some data var app = new Component(\\u0026#39;#app\\u0026#39;, { data: { greeting: \\u0026#39;Hello\\u0026#39;, name: \\u0026#39;world\\u0026#39; }, template: function (props) { return props.greeting + \\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39; + props.name + \\u0026#39;!\\u0026#39;; } });  Sanitizing state If your state includes user-provided content, the Component() function has a sanitize() method built into it that you can use to strip out malicious code and avoid cross-site scripting attacks.\\n// Some data var app = new Component(\\u0026#39;#app\\u0026#39;, { data: { greeting: \\u0026#39;Hello\\u0026#39;, name: \\u0026#39;world\\u0026#39; }, template: function (props) { return props.greeting + \\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39; + Component.sanitize(props.name) + \\u0026#39;!\\u0026#39;; } });  Rendering your component To render a component, call the render() method on it.\\n// Create a component var app = new Component(\\u0026#39;#app\\u0026#39;, { data: { greeting: \\u0026#39;Hello\\u0026#39;, name: \\u0026#39;world\\u0026#39; }, template: function (props) { return props.greeting + \\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39; + props.name + \\u0026#39;!\\u0026#39;; } }); // Render the component app.render();  Here\\u0026rsquo;s a demo.\\nUpdating your state The data is a property of your component. You can access and update it directly on the component.\\napp.data.greeting = \\u0026#39;Bonjour\\u0026#39;; app.data.name = \\u0026#39;Universe\\u0026#39;;  You can update your component in the DOM by calling the render() method again.\\napp.render();  Here\\u0026rsquo;s an updated demo. It renders the initial layout, and uses setTimeout() to update the state and re-render the UI 2 seconds later.\\nwindow.setTimeout(function () { app.data.greeting = \\u0026#39;Bonjour\\u0026#39;; app.data.name = \\u0026#39;Universe\\u0026#39;; app.render(); }, 2000);  The Component() helper function Here\\u0026rsquo;s the full code for the Component() helper function.

Otherwise, we\\u0026rsquo;ll assign the element selector, the template, and any data that was provided as properties of the component.\\n/** * Create the Component object * @param {String|Node} elem The element to make into a component * @param {Object} options The component options */ var Component = function (elem, options) { if (!elem) throw \\u0026#39;ComponentJS: You did not provide an element to make into a component.\\u0026#39;; this.elem = elem; this.data = options ? options.data : null; this.template = options ? options.template : null; };  Adding a sanitize method It\\u0026rsquo;s common for web apps to include user-provided data. Since this poses a risk for cross-site scripting attacks, the Component() function includes a sanitize() method that can be used to remove malicious code.\\n/** * Sanitize and encode all HTML in a user-submitted string * @param {String} str The user-submitted string * @return {String} The sanitized string */ Component.sanitize = function (str) { var temp = document.createElement(\\u0026#39;div\\u0026#39;); temp.textContent = str; return temp.innerHTML; };  Rendering a component Next, we\\u0026rsquo;re going to assign a method to the prototype of our Component() function.\\nWhenever we create a new component, it will refer to this original function instead of creating a new copy of it, reducing the load on our memory in the browser.\\n/** * Render a template into the DOM * @return {[type]} The element */ Component.prototype.render = function () { // Make sure there\\u0026#39;s a template \\tif (!this.template) throw \\u0026#39;ComponentJS: No template was provided.\\u0026#39;; // If elem is an element, use it. \\t// If it\\u0026#39;s a selector, get it. \\tvar elem = typeof this.elem === \\u0026#39;string\\u0026#39; ? document.querySelector(this.elem) : this.elem; if (!elem) return; // Get the template \\tvar template = (typeof this.template === \\u0026#39;function\\u0026#39; ? this.template(this.data) : this.template); if (typeof template !== \\u0026#39;string\\u0026#39;) return; // Render the template into the element \\tif (elem.innerHTML === template) return; elem.innerHTML = template; // Dispatch a render event \\tif (typeof window.CustomEvent === \\u0026#39;function\\u0026#39;) { var event = new CustomEvent(\\u0026#39;render\\u0026#39;, { bubbles: true }); elem.dispatchEvent(event); } // Return the elem for use elsewhere \\treturn elem; };  In our render() method, we\\u0026rsquo;re going to make sure the component has a template property. If not, we\\u0026rsquo;ll throw an error.\\nIf the elem property is a string, we\\u0026rsquo;ll use querySelector() to get the element. If it\\u0026rsquo;s a node, we\\u0026rsquo;ll use that node directly.\\nSimilarly, if the template property is a string or number, we\\u0026rsquo;ll use it outright. If it\\u0026rsquo;s a function, we\\u0026rsquo;ll run it to get a string (or number).\\nNext, we\\u0026rsquo;ll run a check to make sure the existing innerHTML of our elem differs from the template. If they\\u0026rsquo;re the same, we won\\u0026rsquo;t do anything since there\\u0026rsquo;s nothing new to render. Otherwise, we\\u0026rsquo;ll update the DOM.\\nFinally, we\\u0026rsquo;ll dispatch a custom event that you can hook into with addEventListener(), letting you trigger other actions whenever a piece of content is updated. Then we\\u0026rsquo;ll return the elem itself.\\nAbout custom events When content is updated, you may need to reinitialize some JavaScript elsewhere in your code base or take additional actions.\\nThe CustomEvent API let\\u0026rsquo;s you create a custom event type that you can listen for with addEventListener. In the Component.render() method, it\\u0026rsquo;s dispatched on the element that was rendered, and bubbles so that you can use event delegation if you want.\\ndocument.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;render\\u0026#39;, function (event) { if (event.target.matches(\\u0026#39;#app\\u0026#39;)) { // Do something... \\t} }, false);  An example To make this all more tangible, let\\u0026rsquo;s create a simple clock using a stateful component.\\nHere\\u0026rsquo;s the HTML.\\n\\u0026lt;div id=\\u0026#34;clock\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt; Now, let\\u0026rsquo;s create a component.\\nWe\\u0026rsquo;ll use the Date() object and it\\u0026rsquo;s toLocaleTimeString() method to get the current time and assign it to the time property in our state. Our template will return The time is followed by this property.\\n// Create a clock component var clock = new Component(\\u0026#39;#clock\\u0026#39;, { data: { time: new Date().toLocaleTimeString() }, template: function (props) { return \\u0026#39;The time is \\u0026#39; + props.time; } });  Now we can render it into the DOM.\\n// Render the clock clock.render();  Now we\\u0026rsquo;ve got a simple app that shows you the time when you load the page. Here it is in action.\\nThat\\u0026rsquo;s a great start, but we want to update the clock in real time.\\nTo make that happen, we\\u0026rsquo;ll use the setInterval() method to run a callback function every 1000 millseconds, or 1 second. In that function, we\\u0026rsquo;ll update our state and render a fresh UI.\\n// Update the clock once a second window.setInterval(function () { clock.data.time = new Date().toLocaleTimeString(); clock.render(); }, 1000);  Here\\u0026rsquo;s the finished clock app.\\nYou could have done something like this instead.\\n// Get the clock element from the DOM var clock = document.querySelector(\\u0026#39;#clock\\u0026#39;); // Set the initial time clock.innerHTML = new Date().toLocaleTimeString(); // Update the time once a second window.setInterval(function () { clock.innerHTML = new Date().toLocaleTimeString(); }, 1000);  And honestly, for really simple apps like this, that\\u0026rsquo;s definitely the smarter and easier approach.\\nWhen you start building bigger web apps, though, that targeted manipulation becomes a lot harder to manage. Tomorrow, we\\u0026rsquo;ll build a stopwatch app together, and see how building a fresh UI based on state can make maintaining a web app easier and simpler.\\n\",\"summary\":\"Yesterday, we talked about what state is and how to create state-based components with vanilla JS.\\nToday, I\\u0026rsquo;m going to show you a small helper function that makes creating stateful components (and rendering them into the DOM) easier, without having to rely on a big framework or library.

This works, but as your apps grow, it can be tedious to manage.\\nToday\\u0026rsquo;s more popular JavaScript frameworks, including React and Vue, use state and components to make managing the UI easier.\\nWith this approach, instead of targeting specific elements in the DOM and adjusting a class here or a style there, you treat your data, or state, as the single source of truth.\\nUpdated your state, render a fresh copy of the UI based on the new data, and move on. You never have to think about which element in the DOM to target or how it needs to change.\\nIn this example below, you can update your state, data, to change what the greeting is.\\n// This is the state var data = { greeting: \\u0026#39;Hello\\u0026#39;, name: \\u0026#39;there\\u0026#39; }; // This is a simple Component var greeting = function () { return \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39; + data.greeting + \\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39; + data.name + \\u0026#39;!\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39;; }; // We can render it like this var app = document.querySelector(\\u0026#39;#app\\u0026#39;); app.innerHTML = greeting();  Here\\u0026rsquo;s a demo.\\n State-based components In the previous example, the state was a global object that any function can access.\\nTo give your code more structure, you might instead scope state to your component. This is how React, Vue, and other popular frameworks do things.\\nHere\\u0026rsquo;s an updated example.\\n// This is a simple Component var greeting = function () { return \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39; + greeting.data.greeting + \\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39; + greeting.data.name + \\u0026#39;!\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39;; }; // This is the state greeting.data = { greeting: \\u0026#39;Hello\\u0026#39;, name: \\u0026#39;there\\u0026#39; } // We can render it like this var app = document.querySelector(\\u0026#39;#app\\u0026#39;); app.innerHTML = greeting();  In this example, the data or state is a property of the component itself. The state is only accessible within (or is scoped to) the component.\\nHere\\u0026rsquo;s an updated demo for you.\\n Why this approach is nice The nice thing about scoping state to a component like this is that you get out of the business of targeting individual elements and manipulating specific things within them.\\nWith a scoped component, you update your state and then render your template. You don\\u0026rsquo;t need to hunt for individual items.\\nYour data is the single source of truth, and it makes updating the UI easier and more consistent.\\nTomorrow, I\\u0026rsquo;ll show you a helper function you can use to make this whole process super easy.

Cross-browser compatibility can be hard, but it doesn\\u0026rsquo;t have to be. In fact, there\\u0026rsquo;s a secret weapon that makes it really easy: polyfills.\\nA polyfill is a term coined by Remy Sharp for a snippet of code that adds support for a feature to browsers that don’t offer it natively.\\nAdd polyfills globally to your code base, and then you can use modern JavaScript methods and browser APIs without having to transpile your code into older code or do anything special.\\nThere are polyfill\\u0026rsquo;s scattered all around the web, but I\\u0026rsquo;m obsessed with polyfill.io, a free service that detects your visitor\\u0026rsquo;s browser and automatically sends back only the polyfills they need for their browser.\\nOn the latest version of Chrome they get nothing, while IE 7 get\\u0026rsquo;s about 15kb of minified and gzipped code (still far smaller than the latest version of jQuery, React, or Vue).\\nIf you\\u0026rsquo;d rather just manually add what you need, I maintain a growing list of polyfills on the Vanill JS Toolkit.\\n2. How to make their modern code work in older browsers. See above. Polyfills.\\nI used to take great care to avoid ES6 methods and only use ES5, which works back to IE 9. Today, I just use polyfills and forget about it.\\nIt\\u0026rsquo;s worth nothing that not everything is polyfillable.\\nFat arrow functions, and let and const, for example, cannot be polyfilled. As a result, I avoid them in favor of traditional functions and old-fashioned var. It works fine!\\n3. How far back they should provide support. This is a moving target, and varies depending on project.\\nLet\\u0026rsquo;s say you\\u0026rsquo;re not building a single page app or anything. JavaScript just adds flavor for animations, expand-and-collapse menus and such.\\nToday, I would aim for IE11 and up, and ensure that content behind things like expand-and-collapse menus is only hidden when the JavaScript loads and runs.\\nIf the entire content of the site depends on JavaScript, I\\u0026rsquo;d try to go as far back as humanly possible.

I\\u0026rsquo;m not really suggesting you inline everything, am I?\\nI am.\\nWhat? Yesterday, I shared Mariko Kosaka\\u0026rsquo;s wonderful drawings explaining HTTP and how it works.\\nThere are a few nuances to how HTTP works that impact web performance.\\n Both CSS and JavaScript are render blocking, so when a browser comes across a file of that type in the HTML, it waits until it\\u0026rsquo;s finished before rendering anything else. Downloading multiple smaller files is slower than downloading a single file of the same combined size, because of the lookups, handshakes, and \\u0026ldquo;queuing process\\u0026rdquo; that happens. This isn\\u0026rsquo;t true anymore with HTTP2, but older browsers and unencrypted sites don\\u0026rsquo;t support it. Data for any particular file is transferred in small chunks of about 14kb. So if you have, for example, a 250kb image, 18 small packets of data will be sent one-at-a-time for it.  Because of these things, if the combined weight of your above-the-fold (not a real thing) CSS, HTML, and JS is 14kb or less (after minifying and gzipping), it\\u0026rsquo;s more performant to embed it all into the HTML document.\\nWhy? Because instead of three or more separate trips, the browser gets everything it needs to start rendering the page immediately and can just get to it.\\nI tried this on my own site All of the CSS and JavaScript for GoMakeThings.com is inlined.\\nFor a typical article page on the site, the total HTML weight with this approach is 12kb to 13kb with gzipping. For my longer ones, it\\u0026rsquo;s around 16kb, but that still gets all of the above-the-fold stuff over in a single packet.\\nBefore and after making the switch, I ran some tests on WebPagtest.org.\\nMy start-render time dropped by 200ms. My complete render time did, too.\\nI ran some tests on slower networks and locations around the world (farther away from where my server is). It shaved entire seconds off for them.\\nWho should do this? If you\\u0026rsquo;re using a huge stylesheet, this won\\u0026rsquo;t work well for you.\\n(And also, we need to talk! You\\u0026rsquo;re stylesheet doesn\\u0026rsquo;t need to be so damn big!)\\nMy CSS is 15kb minified, before gzipping. Gzipping reduces file size by about 70%, bringing it down to 4.5kb. My JavaScript is 10kb pre-gzip, 3kb after. That gives me a total of 7.5kb, and leaves me with about 6.5kb for HTML before I get to 14kb total weight.\\nIf you\\u0026rsquo;re using tons of libraries and frameworks, you\\u0026rsquo;re going to blow through that budget really quick, and this definitely won\\u0026rsquo;t be the right approach for you.\\nAutomating this with Hugo I use Hugo, a static site generator, for all of my projects.\\nIts templating system makes it really easy for me to update my CSS and JavaScript as external files, and automatically pull them in and inline them.\\nHere\\u0026rsquo;s how it works: in my config.yml file, I have a custom parameter called minify.\\nparams: description: \\u0026quot;Vanilla JavaScript for beginners and designers.\\u0026quot; minify: true  This let\\u0026rsquo;s me easily switch between using the minified and unminified versions of my files for debugging purposes.\\nIn my header.html template, I add style elements, and use some Hugo/Go logic, readFile, to import my file contents.

I was under the assumption that Creative Commons licenses are not appropriate for software use, and indeed that is the case.\\n Can I apply a Creative Commons license to software? We recommend against using Creative Commons licenses for software. Instead, we strongly encourage you to use one of the very good software licenses which are already available. We recommend considering licenses made available by the Free Software Foundation or listed as “open source” by the Open Source Initiative.\\nUnlike software-specific licenses, CC licenses do not contain specific terms about the distribution of source code, which is often important to ensuring the free reuse and modifiability of software. Many software licenses also address patent rights, which are important to software but may not be applicable to other copyrightable works. Additionally, our licenses are currently not compatible with the major software licenses, so it would be difficult to integrate CC-licensed work with other free software. Existing software licenses were designed specifically for use with software and offer a similar set of rights to the Creative Commons licenses.\\n However, CC0 is different. According to the FAQs, it is ok to use for software. However, it comes with some caveats (emphasis mine).\\n Yes, CC0 is suitable for dedicating your copyright and related rights in computer software to the public domain, to the fullest extent possible under law. Unlike CC licenses, which should not be used for software, CC0 is compatible with many software licenses, including the GPL. However, CC0 has not been approved by the Open Source Initiative and does not license or otherwise affect any patent rights you may have. You may want to consider using an approved OSI license that does so instead of CC0, such as GPL 3.0 or Apache 2.0.\\n When the makers of a license tell you that another license is probably a better choice\\u0026hellip;\\nI have two issues with CC0 for code:\\n When I author code, I want to retain my copyright ownership. Some of my open source projects represent hundreds of hours of free labor. I\\u0026rsquo;m happy to have other people benefit from that, but don\\u0026rsquo;t want to completely absolve myself of ownership. If organizations aren\\u0026rsquo;t comfortable and familiar with a license, it\\u0026rsquo;s less likely that people can use it. MIT is well known by legal teams. It\\u0026rsquo;s an easy sell. CCO? Less so.  I had at least one person respond back asking why I give a damn about developers at corporations being able to use my code at all.\\nThey don\\u0026rsquo;t contribute much to open source, and take and benefit a lot from it, the argument goes.\\nBut that thinking penalizes developers, not companies. I want to make it as easy as possible for as many people as possible to be successful at making things for the web. That means using a license that developers everywhere can have an easy time using on their projects.\\n\",\"summary\":\"I received some interesting comments on yesterday\\u0026rsquo;s article about open source and copyright.\\nA few folks pointed me to the Creative Commons Zero license, which functions like a \\u0026ldquo;public domain\\u0026rdquo; license.

Walking.\\nBut the North side kids have a two hour commute.\\nLet\\u0026rsquo;s say that classes at South Side start at 8am. And being late to homeroom penalIzes your grade.\\nNow these rules apply to everyone equally.\\nBut they affect the North Side kids more deeply\\nA North side kid has to get up way earlier in the morning than a South side kid to make it to class on time.\\nThis means that the likelihood of being late to homeroom is also higher.\\nWhich means that they have to work harder to not get grade penalties.\\nThe North Side kids also either have to choose between getting less done after school (homework, family time, recreation, extra curriculars) or getting less sleep.\\nBoth put them at a disadvantage versus the South Side kids.\\nNow let\\u0026rsquo;s say that not only are there penalties for poor attendance, but perks for coming in early.\\nAnyone who does, gets a boost in their grade.\\nNow the North side kids are falling behind twice.

A few years later, I used that same advice to transition myself into a web development role.\\nTo help me do this, I spent nights and weekends teaching myself to code, open sourcing projects, getting feedback, reaching out to people, putting in the hours.\\nI worked hard.

We\\u0026rsquo;ll pass our autocompletes fields into a setup() function.\\nvar autocomplete = function () { \\u0026#39;use strict\\u0026#39;; // Check if datalist is supported \\tvar supportsDatalist = function () { return \\u0026#39;list\\u0026#39; in document.createElement(\\u0026#39;input\\u0026#39;) \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; !!(document.createElement(\\u0026#39;datalist\\u0026#39;) \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; window.HTMLDataListElement); }; // Don\\u0026#39;t run if datalist is supported natively \\tif (supportsDatalist()) return; // Get all autocomplete fields \\tvar autocompletes = document.querySelectorAll(\\u0026#39;input[list]\\u0026#39;); if (autocompletes.length \\u0026lt; 1) return; // Setup the DOM \\tsetup(autocompletes); };  For each autocomplete field, we want to get the corresponding datalist.\\nTo do that, we\\u0026rsquo;ll get the list attribute from the field, and pass it into getElementById(). Then, we\\u0026rsquo;ll use querySelectorAll() to search for option elements just within that element.\\nvar setup = function (autocompletes) { autocompletes.forEach(function (autocomplete) { var datalist = document.getElementById(autocomplete.getAttribute(\\u0026#39;list\\u0026#39;)); if (!datalist) return; // Get datalist options \\tvar options = datalist.querySelectorAll(\\u0026#39;option\\u0026#39;); if (options.length \\u0026lt; 1) return; }); };  Now we want to create an array with our option values. We\\u0026rsquo;ll pass the NodeList of option elements through Array.from() to convert it to an array, and then use the Array.map() method to create a new array.\\nEach item in the new optionsMap array will contain the text from the corresponding option element.\\nvar setup = function (autocompletes) { autocompletes.forEach(function (autocomplete) { var datalist = document.getElementById(autocomplete.getAttribute(\\u0026#39;list\\u0026#39;)); if (!datalist) return; // Get datalist options \\tvar options = datalist.querySelectorAll(\\u0026#39;option\\u0026#39;); if (options.length \\u0026lt; 1) return; // Create an array of available options \\tvar optionsMap = Array.from(options).map(function (option) { return option.textContent; }); }); };  Finally, we\\u0026rsquo;ll add a new attribute to our input\\u0026mdash;[data-list-map]\\u0026mdash;with a stringified version of the optionsMap array as it\\u0026rsquo;s value.\\nThis will let us quickly and easily get a list of options that we can parse with JavaScript.\\nvar setup = function (autocompletes) { autocompletes.forEach(function (autocomplete) { var datalist = document.getElementById(autocomplete.getAttribute(\\u0026#39;list\\u0026#39;)); if (!datalist) return; // Get datalist options \\tvar options = datalist.querySelectorAll(\\u0026#39;option\\u0026#39;); if (options.length \\u0026lt; 1) return; // Create an array of available options \\tvar optionsMap = Array.from(options).map(function (option) { return option.textContent; }); // Save the array to the DOM \\tautocomplete.setAttribute(\\u0026#39;data-list-map\\u0026#39;, JSON.stringify(optionsMap)); }); };  Detecting when the user types in a field Now, we need to show a list of options when the user types. We\\u0026rsquo;ll listen for input events, which fire whenever an input field changes in value.\\nSince we may have multiple autocomplete fields, we\\u0026rsquo;ll use event delegation to listen to all events in the document and filter out the ones we don\\u0026rsquo;t need. We\\u0026rsquo;ll create a changeHandler() function to handle this event.\\ndocument.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;input\\u0026#39;, changeHandler, false);  In our changeHandler() method, we first need to check if the input has the map of options we created in the setup() method. If it doesn\\u0026rsquo;t, it\\u0026rsquo;s not an autocomplete field and we can bail.\\nvar changeHandler = function (event) { // Check if item has an options map \\tvar optionsMap = input.getAttribute(\\u0026#39;data-list-map\\u0026#39;); // Only run for inputs that have an associated datalist \\tif (!optionsMap) return; };  Next, we want to convert our string of data back into an array using JSON.parse().\\nThen, we can use that data to render a list of options for the user. We\\u0026rsquo;ll pass the input and our data into a renderAutocomplete() helper method.\\nvar changeHandler = function (event) { // Check if item has an options map \\tvar optionsMap = event.target.getAttribute(\\u0026#39;data-list-map\\u0026#39;); // Only run for inputs that have an associated datalist \\tif (!optionsMap) return; // Convert optionsMap string to an array \\toptionsMap = JSON.parse(optionsMap); renderAutocomplete(event.target, optionsMap); };  Rendering the autocomplete options Our optionsMap contains a full list of options, but based on what the user typed, only some of them will be viable choices.\\nLet\\u0026rsquo;s create a new array that only contains potential matches. To do this, we\\u0026rsquo;ll use the Array.filter() method on our options.\\nWe want to do a case-insensitive comparison, so we\\u0026rsquo;ll convert each option and the input value itself to lower case with toLowerCase(). Next, we\\u0026rsquo;ll use indexOf() to check if the input.value exists in part or full in the option.\\nThe indexOf() method returns -1 if the item isn\\u0026rsquo;t found. Otherwise, it returns the index for where in the string the item starts. As long as it\\u0026rsquo;s not -1, we\\u0026rsquo;ll return the option to our new array.\\nvar renderAutocomplete = function (input, options) { // Get potential options \\tvar potentialOptions = options.filter(function (option) { return option.toLowerCase().indexOf(input.value.toLowerCase()) !== -1; }); // If there are no options, quit \\tif (potentialOptions.length \\u0026lt; 1) return; };  Next, we\\u0026rsquo;re going to create a list of items.\\nWe\\u0026rsquo;ll setup our unordered list using document.createElement(). We\\u0026rsquo;ll give it a class of autocomplete and an id of autocomplete-{datalist ID}, using getAttribute() to get the input\\u0026rsquo;s list attribute.\\nThen, we\\u0026rsquo;ll through each potential option, create a list item with a button inside it (so that users can tab through the list with a keyboard), and our option as the value.\\nvar renderAutocomplete = function (input, options) { // Get potential options \\tvar potentialOptions = options.filter(function (option) { return option.toLowerCase().indexOf(input.value.toLowerCase()) !== -1; }); // If there are no options, quit \\tif (potentialOptions.length \\u0026lt; 1) return; // Create list of options \\tvar select = document.createElement(\\u0026#39;ul\\u0026#39;); select.className = \\u0026#39;autocomplete\\u0026#39;; select.id = \\u0026#39;autocomplete-\\u0026#39; + input.getAttribute(\\u0026#39;list\\u0026#39;); potentialOptions.forEach(function (option) { select.innerHTML += \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;li\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;button\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39; + option + \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;/button\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/li\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39;; }); };  Now we can add our list to the DOM.\\nWe\\u0026rsquo;ll look for an existing list in the DOM, and if one exists, remove it using the Element.remove() method. Then we\\u0026rsquo;ll use the Element.after() method to inject the element into the DOM after our input.\\nvar renderAutocomplete = function (input, options) { // Get potential options \\tvar potentialOptions = options.filter(function (option) { return option.toLowerCase().indexOf(input.value.toLowerCase()) !== -1; }); // If there are no options, quit \\tif (potentialOptions.length \\u0026lt; 1) return; // Create list of options \\tvar select = document.createElement(\\u0026#39;ul\\u0026#39;); var listID = input.getAttribute(\\u0026#39;list\\u0026#39;); select.className = \\u0026#39;autocomplete\\u0026#39;; select.id = \\u0026#39;autocomplete-\\u0026#39; + listID; potentialOptions.forEach(function (option) { select.innerHTML += \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;li\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;button\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39; + option + \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;/button\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/li\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39;; }); // Inject into the DOM \\tvar existing = document.getElementById(\\u0026#39;autocomplete-\\u0026#39; + listID); if (existing) { existing.remove(); } input.after(select); };  Things are working, but this looks really ugly. Let\\u0026rsquo;s add some light styling to make it look nicer.\\nFor the list itself, let\\u0026rsquo;s remove the bullets, and give a border and some light margin and padding tweaks. We don\\u0026rsquo;t want our buttons to look like buttons, we we\\u0026rsquo;ll remove any background or border, make them full width, and align the text to the left.\\n.autocomplete { border: 1px solid #e5e5e5; list-style: none; margin: 0; padding: 5px; width: 100%; } .autocomplete button { background: none; border: none; display: block; text-align: left; width: 100%; } Update the input when the user selects an option When the user selects an item from the list, we need to actually update the field\\nLet\\u0026rsquo;s create a click event, and pass it into a clickHandler() function. This will fire when users hit enter or return on the button, too.\\ndocument.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;click\\u0026#39;, clickHandler, false);  In the clickHandler() method we first want to check if the clicked item is a button in our .autocomplete list, and if not, quick.\\nThen, we\\u0026rsquo;ll look for the input that it belongs to. We\\u0026rsquo;ll do this by removing autocomplete- from the list ID, and using querySelector() to find the input whose [list] attribute value matches it.\\nvar clickHandler = function (event) { var list = event.target.closest(\\u0026#39;.autocomplete\\u0026#39;); if (!list) return; // Get input \\tvar input = document.querySelector(\\u0026#39;input[list=\\u0026#34;\\u0026#39; + list.id.replace(\\u0026#39;autocomplete-\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;) + \\u0026#39;\\u0026#34;]\\u0026#39;); if (!input) return; };  If we find an element, we can set its value to the clicked button\\u0026rsquo;s textContent. Then we\\u0026rsquo;ll use Element.remove() to remove the list of options from the DOM, and focus() to bring focus back to the input.\\nvar clickHandler = function (event) { var list = event.target.closest(\\u0026#39;.autocomplete\\u0026#39;); if (!list) return; // Get input \\tvar input = document.querySelector(\\u0026#39;input[list=\\u0026#34;\\u0026#39; + list.id.replace(\\u0026#39;autocomplete-\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;) + \\u0026#39;\\u0026#34;]\\u0026#39;); if (!input) return; // Update the input \\tinput.value = event.target.textContent; // Remove the list from the DOM \\tlist.remove(); // Return focus to the input \\tinput.focus(); };  Hiding the list of options on blur There\\u0026rsquo;s one last missing piece. When the user navigates out of the input, or out of the list of options, we want to hide the list.\\nTo do this, we\\u0026rsquo;ll listen for blur events and pass them into a blurHandler() helper. blur events don\\u0026rsquo;t normally bubble, so we\\u0026rsquo;ll need to set useCapture to true to use event delegation.\\ndocument.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;blur\\u0026#39;, blurHandler, true);  In our blurHandler(), we first want to make sure the event was run in either an input with the [list] attribute, or a button in our .autocomplete list. If not, we\\u0026rsquo;ll bail.\\nvar blurHandler = function (event) { if (!event.target.closest(\\u0026#39;input[list], .autocomplete\\u0026#39;)) return; };  Since this gets called if the input blurs, we need to check if the list of autocomplete options is still in focus. If so, we don\\u0026rsquo;t have to do anything.\\nHowever, at the time the blur even fires, nothing has focus yet. So, we\\u0026rsquo;re going to wrap the rest of our code in a setTimeout() function that will run 1 ms later, after focus has changed.\\nvar blurHandler = function (event) { if (!event.target.closest(\\u0026#39;input[list], .autocomplete\\u0026#39;)) return; window.setTimeout(function () { // Do something... \\t}, 1); };  We\\u0026rsquo;re going to see if the item currently in focus (document.activeElement) is inside our .autocomplete list. If so, we\\u0026rsquo;ll bail.\\nOtherwise, we\\u0026rsquo;ll get the currently open .autocomplete list and use remove() to remove it from the DOM.\\nvar blurHandler = function (event) { if (!event.target.closest(\\u0026#39;input[list], .autocomplete\\u0026#39;)) return; window.setTimeout(function () { if (document.activeElement.closest(\\u0026#39;.autocomplete\\u0026#39;)) return; var autocomplete = document.querySelector(\\u0026#39;.autocomplete\\u0026#39;); if (!autocomplete) return; autocomplete.remove(); }, 1); };  Here\\u0026rsquo;s a demo you can play with in Safari or some other unsupported browsers.\\n Browser Compatibility This polyfill works back to at least IE9, but does require some additional polyfills of its own.\\nYou\\u0026rsquo;ll need to add polyfills for:\\n Array.forEach() - https://vanillajstoolkit.com/polyfills/arrayforeach/ NodeList.forEach() - https://vanillajstoolkit.com/polyfills/nodelistforeach/ Array.from() - https://vanillajstoolkit.com/polyfills/arrayfrom/ Array.map() - https://vanillajstoolkit.com/polyfills/arraymap/ Array.filter() - https://vanillajstoolkit.com/polyfills/arrayfilter/ Element.after() - https://vanillajstoolkit.com/polyfills/after/ Element.remove() - https://vanillajstoolkit.com/polyfills/remove/ Element.closest() - https://vanillajstoolkit.com/polyfills/closest/  You can make life easier for yourself by using a polyfill service like https://polyfill.io, though you\\u0026rsquo;ll still need to polyfill NodeList.forEach() as that\\u0026rsquo;s not yet part of their package of polyfills.\\n\",\"summary\":\"Yesterday, I showed you a 100% browser-native, JavaScript-free way to add autocomplete functionality to your site.\\nUnfortunately, it only works in Chrome, Firefox, and IE11 and up.

This value can be represented as an array of nine items, with each item mapping to the corresponding box in our grid (and [data-id]).\\nTo prevent this default state from being modified, I\\u0026rsquo;m going to make it a function that returns an array to give it immutability. By default, every square is null.\\nvar baseState = function () { return [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]; };  The React version tracks game history, and let\\u0026rsquo;s users show the board in any previous state. To track that, I\\u0026rsquo;ll create an empty array that will hold that data.\\nvar historyState = [];  Finally, I need to store the current state of the board, and who\\u0026rsquo;s turn it is (X or O). I\\u0026rsquo;ll create two placeholder variables for that.\\nvar currentState, turn;  Starting the game When the game loads for the first time, or if the user clicks a \\u0026ldquo;Play Again\\u0026rdquo; button that we\\u0026rsquo;ll add, I want to reset the state and render the game board.\\nThis will set the currentState to the baseState, reset the historyState to an empty array, and set the current turn to X. Then, it will call an updateBoard() function we\\u0026rsquo;ll use to actually generate the board.\\n/** * Reset the board to it\\u0026#39;s base state */ var resetBoard = function () { currentState = baseState(); historyState = []; turn = \\u0026#39;X\\u0026#39;; updateBoard(); }; // Reset the board when the game loads resetBoard();  In the updateBoard() function, I use querySelector to get the #game-board and update it with innerHTML.\\nIf a game state is passed into it, we can use that. Otherwise, we\\u0026rsquo;ll use the currentState. We\\u0026rsquo;ll create another helper function, buildBoard(), to generate the actual markup string.\\n/** * Update the board based on a state * @param {Array} state The state to update from (optional, defaults to currentState) */ var updateBoard = function (state) { var board = document.querySelector(\\u0026#39;#game-board\\u0026#39;) if (!board) return; board.innerHTML = buildBoard(state || currentState); };  Building the board In the buildBoard() function, I create a rows variable to hold the markup string, and create a table element.\\nFor each square in the state, I need to create a td element, setup in rows of three. To keep this script lean and clean, we\\u0026rsquo;ll handle that in a buildSquares() method (more on that in a second).\\nThen, I\\u0026rsquo;ll close off the table and add a \\u0026ldquo;Play Again\\u0026rdquo; button. Finally, I\\u0026rsquo;ll return the markup string.\\n/** * Build the game board * @param {Array} state The state to build from * @return {String} The markup based on the state */ var buildBoard = function (state) { // Setup the table \\tvar rows = \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;table\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;tbody\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39;; // Create each square \\trows += buildSquares(state); rows += \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;/tbody\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/table\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;button id=\\u0026#34;play-again\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;Play Again\\u0026lt;/button\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39;; return rows; };  In the buildSquares() method, I\\u0026rsquo;ll setup an empty string assigned to the rows variable. This will eventually hold the data for each row in our table.\\nI\\u0026rsquo;ll use forEach() to loop through each item in the state (our array of squares). If it\\u0026rsquo;s not null, I\\u0026rsquo;ll\\u0026hellip;\\n Use it\\u0026rsquo;s value as our button text (the value variable). Add an aria-pressed=\\u0026quot;true\\u0026quot; attribute (the selected variable). Add a disabled attribute (the disabled variable).  I also need to check if the current square is the first in a row (and if so create a new tr), or the last in the row (and if so close the current tr). For now, I\\u0026rsquo;ll move the functionality for that to isFirstInRow() and isLastInRow() methods.\\nFinally, I\\u0026rsquo;ll return my rows string so that it can be concatenated in the buildBoard() function.\\nvar buildSquares = function (state) { // Setup rows \\tvar rows = \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;; // Loop through each square in the state \\tstate.forEach(function (square, id) { // Variables \\tvar value = square ? square : \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;; var selected = square ? \\u0026#39; aria-pressed=\\u0026#34;true\\u0026#34;\\u0026#39; : \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;; var disabled = square ? \\u0026#39; disabled\\u0026#39; : \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;; // Check if it\\u0026#39;s a new row \\tif (isFirstInRow(id)) { rows += \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;tr\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39;; } rows += \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;td\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;button class=\\u0026#34;game-square\\u0026#34; data-id=\\u0026#34;\\u0026#39; + id + \\u0026#39;\\u0026#34;\\u0026#39; + selected + disabled + \\u0026#39;\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39; + value + \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;/button\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/td\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39;; // Check if it\\u0026#39;s the last column in a row \\tif (isLastInRow(id)) { rows += \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;/tr\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39;; } }); return rows; };  So, how do we check if it\\u0026rsquo;s the first or last square in a row?\\nWe can use a modulo operator (%) to divide the square\\u0026rsquo;s index by the number of items in our row (3) and get the remainder.\\nThe math is easier when you start at 1, so we\\u0026rsquo;ll add 1 to the index before doing this. Squares 1, 4, and 7 (after adding 1) are the first in each row. Squares 3, 6, and, 9 (after adding 1) are the last.\\n1 / 3, 4 / 3, and 7 / 3 have a remainder of 1. 3 / 3, 6 / 3, and 9 / 3 have a remainder of 0. Using the modulo operator to get the remainder will tell us if the square is first or last in a row. We\\u0026rsquo;ll check the remainder and return a boolean.\\nvar isFirstInRow = function (id) { return (id + 1) % 3 === 1; }; var isLastInRow = function (id) { return (id + 1) % 3 === 0; };  Playing the game Now we\\u0026rsquo;re ready to actually play!\\nLet\\u0026rsquo;s use event bubbling to listen for click events on the document.\\n// Listen for selections document.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;click\\u0026#39;, function (event) { // Do something... }, false);  If the #play-again button was clicked, we can call the resetBoard() method to wipe out the current states and render a clean board.\\nIf the clicked element was our .game-square buttons and it doesn\\u0026rsquo;t have a disabled attribute, we\\u0026rsquo;ll update the state and render the board again. We\\u0026rsquo;ll handle that in a renderTurn() helper function, passing in the button.\\n// Listen for selections document.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;click\\u0026#39;, function (event) { // If #play-again was clicked \\tif (event.target.matches(\\u0026#39;#play-again\\u0026#39;)) { resetBoard(); } // If a .game-square was clicked \\tif (event.target.matches(\\u0026#39;.game-square\\u0026#39;) \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; !event.target.hasAttribute(\\u0026#39;disabled\\u0026#39;)) { renderTurn(event.target); } }, false);  First, we\\u0026rsquo;ll get the square\\u0026rsquo;s ID from the [data-id] attribute.\\n/** * Render the board again based on the current user\\u0026#39;s turn * @param {Node} square The square that was selected */ var renderTurn = function (square) { // Get selected value \\tvar selected = square.getAttribute(\\u0026#39;data-id\\u0026#39;); if (!selected) return; };  We\\u0026rsquo;ll update that square in the currentState array to the turn value. This starts with X, and, as you\\u0026rsquo;ll see further in this function, switches between X and O with each turn.\\n/** * Render the board again based on the current user\\u0026#39;s turn * @param {Node} square The square that was selected */ var renderTurn = function (square) { // Get selected value \\tvar selected = square.getAttribute(\\u0026#39;data-id\\u0026#39;); if (!selected) return; // Update state \\tcurrentState[selected] = turn; };  Next, we want to add the current state of the board to the historyState array. We\\u0026rsquo;ll do this using the .push() method, and pass in a fresh copy of the currentState by using the .slice() method on it.\\n/** * Render the board again based on the current user\\u0026#39;s turn * @param {Node} square The square that was selected */ var renderTurn = function (square) { // Get selected value \\tvar selected = square.getAttribute(\\u0026#39;data-id\\u0026#39;); if (!selected) return; // Update state \\tcurrentState[selected] = turn; // Add a historical state \\thistoryState.push(currentState.slice()); };  Now, we can update the board markup by calling our updateBoard() method. We\\u0026rsquo;ll also update the turn variable. If it\\u0026rsquo;s currently X we\\u0026rsquo;ll switch it to O and vice-versa.\\n/** * Render the board again based on the current user\\u0026#39;s turn * @param {Node} square The square that was selected */ var renderTurn = function (square) { // Get selected value \\tvar selected = square.getAttribute(\\u0026#39;data-id\\u0026#39;); if (!selected) return; // Update state \\tcurrentState[selected] = turn; // Add a historical state \\thistoryState.push(currentState.slice()); // Render with new state \\tupdateBoard(); // Update turn \\tturn = turn === \\u0026#39;X\\u0026#39; ? \\u0026#39;O\\u0026#39; : \\u0026#39;X\\u0026#39;; };  What about the history state? We\\u0026rsquo;re tracking the turn history, but not doing anything with it just yet. Let\\u0026rsquo;s fix that!\\nIn the buildBoard() method, let\\u0026rsquo;s concatenate a buildHistory() method at the end of our rows variable.

In the example below, setting a new variable of str2 by calling slice() on str1 in no way changes the value of str1;\\nvar str1 = \\u0026#39;Hello, there!\\u0026#39;; var str2 = str1.slice(0, 5); // logs \\u0026#34;Hello, there!\\u0026#34; console.log(str1); // logs \\u0026#34;Hello\\u0026#34; console.log(str2);  You can still change the value of str1.\\nstr1 = \\u0026#39;Goodbye, friend!\\u0026#39;;  But the value of the the original string itself doesn\\u0026rsquo;t change when do things with it.\\nNumbers Numbers are also immutable. Doing some math on the num1 variable and setting it to a new variable doesn\\u0026rsquo;t change the value of num1.\\nvar num1 = 42; var num2 = num1 - 7; // logs 42 console.log(num1); // logs 35 console.log(num2);  This all seem painfully obvious, right? Then we get to arrays and objects.\\nArrays Arrays are mutable.\\nIn the example below, we\\u0026rsquo;re setting the variable arr2 to the value of arr1, and then pushing a item, cookie, into it.\\nSurprisingly, the value of arr1 changed, too! In this example, arr2 isn\\u0026rsquo;t a new array the way referencing strings and numbers would be. It\\u0026rsquo;s the original array pointed to by another variable.\\nvar arr1 = [\\u0026#39;sandwich\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;soda\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;chips\\u0026#39;]; var arr2 = arr1; arr2.push(\\u0026#39;cookie\\u0026#39;); // logs [\\u0026#34;sandwich\\u0026#34;, \\u0026#34;soda\\u0026#34;, \\u0026#34;chips\\u0026#34;, \\u0026#34;cookie\\u0026#34;] console.log(arr1); // logs [\\u0026#34;sandwich\\u0026#34;, \\u0026#34;soda\\u0026#34;, \\u0026#34;chips\\u0026#34;, \\u0026#34;cookie\\u0026#34;] console.log(arr2);  Objects Objects are also mutable.\\nHere, we\\u0026rsquo;re setting the value of obj2 to obj1, and then adding a new item with a key of cookie and value of chocolate chip to it. But when you log both objects, they have all of the same properties!\\nvar obj1 = { sandwich: \\u0026#39;turkey\\u0026#39;, soda: \\u0026#39;Pepsi\\u0026#39;, chips: \\u0026#39;Cape Cod\\u0026#39; }; var obj2 = obj1; obj2.cookie = \\u0026#39;chocolate chip\\u0026#39;; // logs {sandwich: \\u0026#34;turkey\\u0026#34;, soda: \\u0026#34;Pepsi\\u0026#34;, chips: \\u0026#34;Cape Cod\\u0026#34;, cookie: \\u0026#34;chocolate chip\\u0026#34;} console.log(obj1); // logs {sandwich: \\u0026#34;turkey\\u0026#34;, soda: \\u0026#34;Pepsi\\u0026#34;, chips: \\u0026#34;Cape Cod\\u0026#34;, cookie: \\u0026#34;chocolate chip\\u0026#34;} console.log(obj2);  The challenge with mutability Often, when setting a new array or object and referencing the value of an exiting one, you\\u0026rsquo;re trying to create a new item and preserve the value of the original.\\nThe mutability of arrays and objects makes it harder to trust the original source of data.\\nTomorrow, we\\u0026rsquo;ll look at some strategies for dealing with mutability.\\n\",\"summary\":\"Today, I wanted to take a quick look at the concept of immutability in JavaScript (or it\\u0026rsquo;s lack thereof), and its implication on how you write code.\\nWhat is \\u0026ldquo;immutability\\u0026rdquo; In JavaScript, things that are immutable don\\u0026rsquo;t change in value when you use them, and things that are mutable do.\\nLet\\u0026rsquo;s look at some examples.\\nStrings First up, strings.

In our function, we\\u0026rsquo;ll create our XHR request.\\nvar makeRequest = function (url, method) { // Create the XHR request \\tvar request = new XMLHttpRequest(); };  Next, we\\u0026rsquo;ll create a Promise object, and return it.\\nvar makeRequest = function (url, method) { // Create the XHR request \\tvar request = new XMLHttpRequest(); // Return it as a Promise \\treturn new Promise(function (resolve, reject) { // The rest of our XHR stuff will go here...  }); };  Inside our Promise, we\\u0026rsquo;ll setup an onreadystatechange listener, just like we would with a traditional XHR request. If we get back a 2xx status (a successful response), we\\u0026rsquo;ll use resolve() to pass along the response. Otherwise, we\\u0026rsquo;ll use reject() to pass along the error information.\\nvar makeRequest = function (url, method) { // Create the XHR request \\tvar request = new XMLHttpRequest(); // Return it as a Promise \\treturn new Promise(function (resolve, reject) { // Setup our listener to process compeleted requests \\trequest.onreadystatechange = function () { // Only run if the request is complete \\tif (request.readyState !== 4) return; // Process the response \\tif (request.status \\u0026gt;= 200 \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; request.status \\u0026lt; 300) { // If successful \\tresolve(request); } else { // If failed \\treject({ status: request.status, statusText: request.statusText }); } }; }); };  Finally, we\\u0026rsquo;ll use the XHR open() method to setup our request with the URL and method (or if one wasn\\u0026rsquo;t provided, GET). Then we\\u0026rsquo;ll send() it.\\nvar makeRequest = function (url, method) { // Create the XHR request \\tvar request = new XMLHttpRequest(); // Return it as a Promise \\treturn new Promise(function (resolve, reject) { // Setup our listener to process compeleted requests \\trequest.onreadystatechange = function () { // Only run if the request is complete \\tif (request.readyState !== 4) return; // Process the response \\tif (request.status \\u0026gt;= 200 \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; request.status \\u0026lt; 300) { // If successful \\tresolve(request); } else { // If failed \\treject({ status: request.status, statusText: request.statusText }); } }; // Setup our HTTP request \\trequest.open(method || \\u0026#39;GET\\u0026#39;, url, true); // Send the request \\trequest.send(); }); };  Using Promise-Based XHR Now, you can make your XHR request by passing in a URL, and optionally a method.\\nmakeRequest(\\u0026#39;https://some-url.com/posts\\u0026#39;) .then(function (posts) { console.log(\\u0026#39;Success!\\u0026#39;, posts); }) .catch(function (error) { console.log(\\u0026#39;Something went wrong\\u0026#39;, error); });  Where this gets really powerful is when you want to make multiple API calls, passing data from one into the next.\\nmakeRequest(\\u0026#39;https://some-url.com/posts\\u0026#39;) .then(function (posts) { return makeRequest(\\u0026#39;https://some-url.com/post/\\u0026#39; + posts[0].id); }) .then(function (post) { return { title: post.title.toUpperCase(), content: post.body, date: post.date } }) .then(function (postData) { renderPost(postData); }) .catch(function (error) { console.log(\\u0026#39;Something went wrong\\u0026#39;, error); });  Making this easier I just converted my simple XHR plugin, Atomic, to use Promises.\\nIt works more-or-less like the sample code above, but allows you to pass in an object of options to set headers, the content type, credentials, and so on.\\nYou can play around with live examples on the demo page.\\nBrowser Compatibility Promises only work natively in modern browsers. However, a Promises polyfill pushes support back to IE7. There\\u0026rsquo;s a polyfill loaded by default in polyfill.io as well.\\nAtomic comes with two versions: a standalone version if you\\u0026rsquo;re loading your own polyfill or don\\u0026rsquo;t want broader backwards support, and one with a polyfill baked in.\\n\",\"summary\":\"Yesterday, I talked about why I still use XHR over fetch().

Huh?\\nWhat\\u0026rsquo;s going on here? From the Mozilla Developer Network:\\n The Promise returned from fetch() won’t reject on HTTP error status even if the response is an HTTP 404 or 500. Instead, it will resolve normally (with ok status set to false), and it will only reject on network failure or if anything prevented the request from completing.\\n In other words, even if your call fails, it fetch() will still treat it like a success.\\nTo make the above call work as expected, you need to check if response.ok is true, and then return the data or throw an error accordingly.\\nfetch(\\u0026#39;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/postses\\u0026#39;) .then(function (response) { if (response.ok) { return response.json(); } else { return Promise.reject({ status: response.status, statusText: response.statusText }); } }) .then(function (data) { console.log(\\u0026#39;success\\u0026#39;, data); }) .catch(function (error) { console.log(\\u0026#39;error\\u0026#39;, error); });  Here\\u0026rsquo;s an updated demo.\\nBetter, but you\\u0026rsquo;re not done! Zell Liew explains in this detailed primer on CSS Tricks:\\n It\\u0026rsquo;s not enough to just tell our .catch statement there\\u0026rsquo;s a bad request. We need more information to tell what\\u0026rsquo;s missing. Did your user forget their first name? Email? Or maybe their credit card information? We won\\u0026rsquo;t know! \\u0026hellip; The solution is to return a promise that contains two then calls. This way, we can first read what\\u0026rsquo;s in response.json, then decide what to do with it.\\n He suggests setting up a handling function that you pass into your first then().\\nvar handleResponse = function (response) { return response.json() .then(function (json) { if (response.ok) { return json; } else { return Promise.reject(response); } }); }; fetch(\\u0026#39;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/postses\\u0026#39;) .then(handleResponse) .then(function (data) { console.log(\\u0026#39;success\\u0026#39;, data); }) .catch(function (error) { console.log(\\u0026#39;error\\u0026#39;, error); });  Here\\u0026rsquo;s a new, updated demo.\\nEven this isn\\u0026rsquo;t enough, though, because it doesn\\u0026rsquo;t account for XML responses\\u0026mdash;only JSON. For that you need to get the content type from the response.headers and do a conditional check on it.\\nAnd this is where I officially throw my hands up in the air and say \\u0026ldquo;to hell with it!\\u0026rdquo; Because this is complete and utter madness.\\nI think most people think of the Fetch API as this high-level helper that makes API calls easier. And at first glance it is.\\nBut once you get into actually working with it, you realize fetch() is actually a low-level API that requires a lot of scaffolding around it. This gives it tremendous flexibility, but takes away much of the ease.\\nThe Fetch API works in all modern browsers, but has no IE support, only works in Safari 10 and up, and Edge support starts at 14.\\nHonestly, this doesn\\u0026rsquo;t seem easier to me than XHR, error handling is weird, and the browser support sucks.\\nSo why do people like the Fetch API In a word, promises.\\nWhen working with APIs, you might need to make an API call, then get that response and make another call, and then another one, or do something with that data.\\nThis can result in nested XHR calls several layers deep. The Fetch API uses promises, so you can chain .then() methods together as many times as needed to keep working with your data.\\nFor example, you can return a new fetch() call using the ID of one of the posts in your response.\\nfetch(\\u0026#39;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts\\u0026#39;) .then(function (response) { if (response.ok) { return response.json(); } else { return Promise.reject({ status: response.status, statusText: response.statusText }); } }) .then(function (data) { console.log(\\u0026#39;success\\u0026#39;, data); return fetch(\\u0026#39;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/\\u0026#39; + data[0].id); }) .then(function (response) { return response.json(); }) .then(function (post) { console.log(\\u0026#39;success\\u0026#39;, post); }) .catch(function (error) { console.log(\\u0026#39;error\\u0026#39;, error); });  Here\\u0026rsquo;s a working demo.\\nThe thing is, you can get the benefits of this using XHR, too.

To me the main driver seems like the advent of large scale web applications — not blogs or content-based sites, but what seem to me like “Web 3.0” software. Along with that comes increased scale, more distributed contributors, and often an increased pace of work. Those things can make it a lot more challenging to embrace the built-in features of CSS, like the global scope, cascade, and, well, choosing naming conventions.\\nI’ve had the chance now to work in what would, relatively speaking, be considered a very small team at a very small company, with a (kinda) small app. I’ve worked with some incredibly talented developers that could not figure out how to keep their CSS styles from turning into an insane pile of spaghetti. It got to the point where we couldn’t add a button to a new form without including an extra entire page of styles to override to overly aggressive and specific styles put in place elsewhere.\\nIt’s totally possible lots of devs just don’t understand CSS well enough, at least not well enough to be trusted to use it at scale in complex applications. But I do think some of the features of CSS are inherently dangerous — it’s a tradeoff, with more power comes more responsibility 🙃\\nAllowing a dev to use button { background: blue } and have it affect, by default, every single button is a totally different philosophy than used in most OOP.\\nAnd I think the biggest challenge is not just understanding CSS and how to use it, but that testing CSS is somewhere between annoying and impossible. Unit testing and feature testing. That’s probably the biggest reason devs who don’t know how to use it well want to avoid using it altogether, because it’s really hard to set up good tests to make sure one change here doesn’t screw stuff up wayyyy over there. Or right here for that matter.\\nYou need lots of manual QA or visual regression testing software. But it’s the type of stuff that’s not natively accessible. Like you can write JS tests in JS, very easily, and be confident in them to catch bugs. But even having automated visual regression testing for a full kitchen sink component library with all your UI in its various states isn’t guaranteed to catch and test the interactions of all these pieces together, i.e. the cascade.\\nAnd actual browser feature tests are the most annoying thing in the world, e.g. selenium and capybara. When it’s hard to write tests and to trust them for a given technology, it’s tempting to just avoid it. Or, in this case, rewrite the technology, change the way we use it.\\nOn my team, as we’re rebuilding our entire app in React on the front-end, I’m pushing us into an almost exclusively atomic CSS world, and so far it’s been a really awesome transition. We’re building a lot faster, our stylesheets are plateau-ing, not ballooning. New developers can get up to speed really quickly. We can still have a design system, which lends itself to better UX. I’m not personally ready to go the CSS-in-JSS route, but I absolutely see its appeal.\\nCSS is hard! And the fact that it’s not a programming language is in and of itself a reason to be nervous using it. It’s more of a black box, and one that requires more discipline to maintain control over.\\nAnd for whatever reason, lots of big apps/teams are feeling similar pain, and finding novel solutions.\\n There\\u0026rsquo;s a lot to unpack here, and I won\\u0026rsquo;t try to discuss all of Andrew\\u0026rsquo;s points, but I did want to touch on just a few of them.\\nFist off, Andrew\\u0026rsquo;s focus is on web things that are pretty different from what I often build (but not always), and I\\u0026rsquo;m also a solo dev, so a lot of the \\u0026ldquo;team issues\\u0026rdquo; I hear come up don\\u0026rsquo;t affect me quite as much.\\nThat said\\u0026hellip;\\nApps vs. Sites  To me the main driver seems like the advent of large scale web applications — not blogs or content-based sites, but what seem to me like “Web 3.0” software. Along with that comes increased scale, more distributed contributors, and often an increased pace of work. Those things can make it a lot more challenging to embrace the built-in features of CSS, like the global scope, cascade, and, well, choosing naming conventions.\\n This still feels to me like throwing engineering at two people problems:\\n The internal code is badly documented, so you need safeguards in place to prevent people from messing it up. JS developers often don\\u0026rsquo;t know CSS that well.  For my money, I\\u0026rsquo;d rather fix those than undo a decade of CSS best practices. The problems are real. I just disagree with the solution.\\nTesting CSS  And I think the biggest challenge is not just understanding CSS and how to use it, but that testing CSS is somewhere between annoying and impossible. Unit testing and feature testing. That’s probably the biggest reason devs who don’t know how to use it well want to avoid using it altogether, because it’s really hard to set up good tests to make sure one change here doesn’t screw stuff up wayyyy over there. Or right here for that matter.\\n This is super spot on!\\nI wouldn\\u0026rsquo;t call unit testing JS easy, but you can write JS tests in JavaScript, and once you learn the conventions, it gets easier.\\nBut how do you test visual changes? How do you identify if they were intentional or not? I\\u0026rsquo;ve done some of this in a previous career, and it\\u0026rsquo;s AWFUL. It involved a lot of command line based screenshots, copy/pasting, rerunning code, and trying to figure out why something was one fucking pixel off from the previous set of screenshots.\\nI\\u0026rsquo;d love a more simple, straightforward way to automate testing CSS.\\nCSS is Hard  CSS is hard! And the fact that it’s not a programming language is in and of itself a reason to be nervous using it. It’s more of a black box, and one that requires more discipline to maintain control over.\\n This is the one statement of Andrew\\u0026rsquo;s I most strongly disagree with.\\nCSS, especially the more advanced stuff, is hard. But so is JavaScript. And because it\\u0026rsquo;s visual, it feels like less of a blackbox to me than JavaScript. YOu can literally see what it\\u0026rsquo;s doing right in front of you.\\nTeams and Communication Many of the challenges CSS-in-JS aims to fix seem to be rooted in poor training, poor communication, and skill gaps across development teams.\\nCSS-in-JS is absolutely a novel solution that helps address those challenges. But it also places developer ease above end-user experience, and throws engineering at what is fundamentally a people problem.\\nI think we can do better.\\n\",\"summary\":\"The other week, I wrote about what\\u0026rsquo;s wrong with CSS-in-JS (and talked about it on my vanilla JS podcast).\\nI had a few thoughtful responses from folks that I wanted to share here.\\nLack of portability Brad Frost expanded on some of my thoughts with some more nuance and added some other reasons why CSS-in-JS not a good approach to front end development.\\nThe one that really jumped out at me is this:\",\"title\":\"Some additional thoughts on CSS-in-JS\",\"url\":\"https://gomakethings.com/some-additional-thoughts-on-css-in-js/\"},{\"categories\":[\"Code\",\"CSS\",\"Design and UX\",\"HTML\",\"JavaScript\"],\"content\":\"Tania Rascia is a developer, designer, and writer who teaches people how to code.\\nI just learned about Primitive, an awesome open source project of her\\u0026rsquo;s.\\nPrimitive is a minimalist Sass boilerplate loosely based on my Kraken CSS boilerplate with some nice enhancements and out-of-the-box defaults.\\nAnd if you were born in the 80s like me and love a good 8-bit logo, the website for the project will tickle you pink.\\nGo check it out!\\n\",\"summary\":\"Tania Rascia is a developer, designer, and writer who teaches people how to code.\\nI just learned about Primitive, an awesome open source project of her\\u0026rsquo;s.\\nPrimitive is a minimalist Sass boilerplate loosely based on my Kraken CSS boilerplate with some nice enhancements and out-of-the-box defaults.\\nAnd if you were born in the 80s like me and love a good 8-bit logo, the website for the project will tickle you pink.\",\"title\":\"Primitive: a minimalist Sass boilerplate\",\"url\":\"https://gomakethings.com/primitive-a-minimalist-sass-boilerplate/\"},{\"categories\":[\"Code\",\"JavaScript\"],\"content\":\"You know what a function is, but you may have also heard the term method used before and wondered what it means.\\nSo what\\u0026rsquo;s the difference between a function and a method?

I use that as the cutoff for my minified and gzipped CSS file when deciding whether or not to inline the critical path CSS.\\nI don\\u0026rsquo;t conditionally load CSS based on which components are used on the page. I keep my stylesheet as lean as possible, use far future headers to benefit from browser caching, and enjoy time-to-first-usable-content times that are below 1 second.\\nOOCSS I\\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of Nicole Sullivan\\u0026rsquo;s Object Oriented CSS approach.\\nI make heavy user of utility classes to nudge and tweak the DOM and keep my stylesheet small. For example, my headings elements typically have a top padding and bottom margin.\\nh1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { margin-bottom: 1em; padding-top: 1em; } h1 { padding-top: 0.5em; } But on my individual articles, I don\\u0026rsquo;t want my headings to have top padding so that the date can site closer to the heading. I could write a component for that.\\n.articles h1 { padding-top: 0; } But there\\u0026rsquo;s a good chance there are other areas in my site I\\u0026rsquo;ll want to remove the padding-top, too. So instead, I use a utility class.\\n.no-padding-top { padding-top: 0; } And I can write my markup like this.\\n\\u0026lt;span\\u0026gt;July 4, 2018\\u0026lt;/span\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;h1 class=\\u0026#34;no-padding-top\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;Happy Independence Day!\\u0026lt;/h1\\u0026gt; I have utilities for font sizes, colors, margin and padding\\u0026hellip; all sorts of things.

I download some third party plugins as compiled JS files. I put them all in a directory, and use Gulp (though Prepos or CodeKit would work, too) to combine them into one file and minify them. I load that file in my site or app.  Nothing fancy. Just a JavaScript file.\\nWhat about dependency management? I work pretty much exclusively with vanilla JavaScript.\\nI\\u0026rsquo;m not using frameworks, and I choose plugins and helpers that don\\u0026rsquo;t depend on other libraries or frameworks, too. I never need to install something like jQuery or lodash for my code to work.\\nGenerally, the only dependency I have is browser support for some native JS methods and browser APIs.\\nHow I handle those depends on the site or app and the role JavaScript plays in how it works.\\nIf JavaScript enhances server-rendered HTML Most of my sites and apps work without JavaScript.\\nServer side rendering and old-fashioned submits handle all of the heavy lifting. JavaScript adds some nice interactivity that enhances the site, but it\\u0026rsquo;s not required for the app to work.\\nIn these type of setup, I\\u0026rsquo;ll use something called \\u0026ldquo;cutting the mustard,\\u0026rdquo; a technique pioneered by the BBC.\\nI check to see if the most cutting edge of the JS methods and browser APIs I use are supported, and if and only if they are, I load my script using loadJS() from the Filament Group.\\n\\u0026lt;script\\u0026gt; function loadJS () { // The loadJS contents are inlined here... \\t} if (\\u0026#39;querySelector\\u0026#39; in document \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; \\u0026#39;localStorage\\u0026#39; in window) { loadJS(\\u0026#39;path/to/my/main.js\\u0026#39;); } \\u0026lt;/script\\u0026gt; If I have some particularly large and rarely used JavaScript, I might conditionally load that separately.

Let\\u0026rsquo;s explore.\\n1. The Global Namespace  It is really crazy to me that the best practices in CSS is still to use global variables. We learned in JS for a long time that globals are bad. Yet, we still use global variables everywhere in CSS. Vjeux\\n CSS is not a programming language, and you can\\u0026rsquo;t think about it the same way you\\u0026rsquo;d think about JavaScript variables and the possible collisions that can happen there.\\nThe global namespace is a feature, not a bug. The cascade is a feature, not a bug.\\nThese two features allow you to write less code and create files that are a lot smaller and more performance\\u0026mdash;if you know how to take advantage of it.\\nMy favorite way to handle this is using Nicole Sullivan\\u0026rsquo;s Object Oriented CSS technique.\\nLet\\u0026rsquo;s say I have a some styles for headings.\\nh1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { font-weight: bold; } h1 { font-size: 2em; } h2 { font-size: 1.5em; } h3 { font-size: 1.2em; } h4, h5, h6 { font-size: 1em; } I occasionally have hero sections and other callouts, and I want to use a bigger, bolder heading in those sections. You could do something like this:\\n.callout h1, .hero h1 { font-size: 3em; } But what happens if the callout happens further down on a page and shouldn\\u0026rsquo;t be an h1? Now I need styles for various use cases.\\n.callout h1, .callout h2, .callout h3, .callout h4, .callout h5, .callout h6, .hero h1, .hero h2, .hero h3, .hero h4, .hero h5, .hero h6 { font-size: 3em; } Or\\u0026hellip; I could use a simple utility class.\\n.hero-text { font-size: 3em; } Classes have more specificity than elements, so the .hero-text class takes priority and the font-size will be 3em.\\nWhen I switched over from a component-based styling approach to a utility-class first approach, I reduced my stylesheet size by more than half.\\n For example Bootstrap introduces a whooping 600 global variables :( Vjeux\\n Bootstrap abuses specificity in its approach to selectors, but this stat in-and-of-itself is not inherently bad or good. 600 small utility classes for little nudges and tweaks could result in a super lean, super performant stylesheet if done right!\\n2. Dependencies  We\\u0026rsquo;re past the way where we can bundle our CSS into a single file and have to split it into many files and therefore deal with dependencies. Vjeux\\n Why?\\nI\\u0026rsquo;m going to speculate here: the stylesheet is huge and it\\u0026rsquo;s a performance issue to load it all at once.\\nIf you understand the cascade and embrace global namespacing, you can dramatically reduce your stylesheet size. Sometimes, larger stylesheets are unavoidable.\\nFor that, you can inline your critical path CSS and asyncronously load the rest. You can also automate what goes into the critical CSS file using some build tool plugins, if you want.\\nAnd with one stylesheet to load, you no longer have to worry about dependency management.\\nOf course, working with modular files can be more convenient for developers. And Sass makes that super easy. You don\\u0026rsquo;t even have to use any of it\\u0026rsquo;s feature. I started using Sass myself just for the modularity and some light variable support.\\nSmaller, modular files can be a performance boost on new browsers and devices that support HTTP2. But for older browsers and devices\\u0026mdash;the ones that need every performance boost they can get\\u0026mdash;it\\u0026rsquo;s actually worse for performance to do this.\\n3. Dead Code Elimination What happens when you have code that\\u0026rsquo;s no longer used?\\nThis is a real problem, and comes up on Twitter as a defense for CSS-in-JS a lot.\\nBut using CSS-in-JS for this is throwing technology at what is fundamentally a people problem. Remove a component from JS or your markup? Remove the CSS, too.\\nIf you\\u0026rsquo;re working with utility classes, that may not even be necessary. And if you\\u0026rsquo;re using an approach like BEM, you remove that component from your styles, just like you would in the JS.\\nWorking with modular Sass files makes this even easier. Just comment out that @import.\\n4. Minification  One side benefit is that we can minify all the class names and send both the JS and CSS a bit faster to users. This also ensures that all the developers are using cx [Facebook\\u0026rsquo;s tool for this] since they cannot guess that name. :) Vjeux\\n The approach Vjeux advocates results in class names like ._f8z.\\nI know he views this is a good thing, because it forces people to use a build tool. But from my perspective, it creates a higher bar for beginner\\u0026rsquo;s to get started and makes debugging a hell of a lot harder. Now you have to hunt for obscure class names that don\\u0026rsquo;t match what you wrote.\\nThe amount of file size savings\\u0026mdash;particularly after gzipping\\u0026mdash;is trivial. You should still minify your CSS, but that doesn\\u0026rsquo;t mean reducing class names to absurd, random strings that mean nothing.\\nYes, we do that in JavaScript. But CSS doesn\\u0026rsquo;t have the same parse and render weight that JavaScript does. The performance implications are different.\\nTo be continued\\u0026hellip; Today I focused on exploring some of the key points in Vjeux\\u0026rsquo;s presentation and where he and I differ in our thinking about front end engineering.\\nHe\\u0026rsquo;s an amazing developer with some really clever approaches to things, and I hope this is viewed as \\u0026ldquo;two passionate professionals disagreeing\\u0026rdquo; than as a personal attack or anything. I think it\\u0026rsquo;s clear he and I both have a deep love for the web.\\nTomorrow, I\\u0026rsquo;m going to share some additional thoughts around CSS-in-JS more generally, and more clearly summarize my preferred approach to building for the web.\\nAnd if you think I missed the mark in any way, I\\u0026rsquo;d love to hear from you.\\n\",\"summary\":\"Yesterday, the wonderful Remy Sharp tweeted:\\n I keep looking at CSS in JS (styled components et al), and the one thing they keep seeming to lack is: why. (and no, \\u0026ldquo;CSS is hard/stressful/etc\\u0026rdquo; isn\\u0026rsquo;t a why, because those all apply to JS too).\\n I weighed in on the discussion, and unleashed a torrent of replies in my mentions.

It\\u0026rsquo;s important to ask the right questions before deciding on a solution.\\nDoes the script require a specific device orientation? Do you only care about viewport width, or does height matter, too? Does the script only impact touch screen inputs, or work with mouse interactions as well? And is it viewport size or actual monitor/screen width you\\u0026rsquo;re interested in?\\nDepending on what your script does, you may only want it to load or run on bigger viewports (or bigger screens, regardless of the viewport size). Or, you may also want it to load on small screens that don\\u0026rsquo;t accept touch inputs. You might not want it to load on big screens that also support touch.\\nAsking the right questions and thinking about edge cases will help you figure out the right approach.\\nWhen the best JavaScript is none at all In this case, the student had an autoplay background video that they didn\\u0026rsquo;t want to load on mobile, out of bandwidth considerations.\\nSide Note: I love that there are developers who still care about and consider bandwidth implications in their work. We need more of that!\\nFor this specific situation, the best approach is actually to let the browser do it\\u0026rsquo;s thing.\\nAn increasing number of mobile browsers automatically block autoplay videos, or give the user the ability to customize whether or not they play. And desktop browsers like Safari and Chrome are moving in that direction as well.\\nWhich is great, because there are too many things we don\\u0026rsquo;t know as developers to let us make informed decisions around this.\\nSomeone could be on a mobile device connected to wifi, or on a desktop device on a terrible connection, or tethered to a mifi network. Screen size is a bad proxy for bandwidth.\\nAny time you can lean on the browser instead of writing code, do it.\\nThis is what thinking in JavaScript means When students tell me they want to learn how to think in JavaScript, this is what they mean.\\nBeing a great developer isn\\u0026rsquo;t about knowing the various methods and browser APIs you can use.

On each iteration, we\\u0026rsquo;ll use Array.indexOf() to see if our item already exists. If the returned index is smaller than the current index, that means an instance of item already exists. Otherwise, we\\u0026rsquo;ll return it to add it to the new array.\\nvar jobsUnique = jobs.filter(function(item, index){ return jobs.indexOf(item) \\u0026gt;= index; }); // Logs [\\u0026#34;Fashion Designer\\u0026#34;, \\u0026#34;Web Developer\\u0026#34;, \\u0026#34;Web Designer\\u0026#34;] console.log(jobsUnique);  We can wrap this in a helper function to make it easier to reuse.\\nvar arrayUnique = function (arr) { return arr.filter(function(item, index){ return arr.indexOf(item) \\u0026gt;= index; }); }; var jobsUnique = arrayUnique(jobs);  Browser Compatibility This approach works in all modern browsers, and IE9 and up. You can push support all the way back to IE6 with a polyfill for Array.filter().\\nUsing some fancy new ES6 stuff ES6 introduced a new object type, Set, that can be used to store data. When passing data into it, duplicates are removed.\\nHowever, a set is not an array, so we also need to pass our new set through the Array.from() method to convert it into one.\\nvar jobsUnique = Array.from(new Set(a)); // Logs [\\u0026#34;Fashion Designer\\u0026#34;, \\u0026#34;Web Developer\\u0026#34;, \\u0026#34;Web Designer\\u0026#34;] console.log(jobsUnique);  This is more performant than our helper function, but also has far less browser support.\\nBrowser Compatibility The Array.from() method works in all modern browsers, but has no IE support.

We need to highlight not just the hovered on star, but the ones before it, and for that, we need JavaScript.\\nLet\\u0026rsquo;s first setup an event listener for hover events. The event we want for this is mouseover. A hover event does not exist.\\ndocument.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;mouseover\\u0026#39;, function (event) { // Our code will go here... }, false);  This is going to bubble up all hover events in the DOM, so we want to check if the event has happened in our .rating form.\\nWe\\u0026rsquo;ll use the closest() method on our event.target to first make sure the event happened on a .star, and to get the .rating form, which we\\u0026rsquo;ll need later in our script.\\nWhy closest() instead of matches()? Our stars are wrapped in a span aria-hidden=\\u0026quot;true\\u0026quot; element, and that\\u0026rsquo;s the element the event.target will map to in most cases, so we need an easy way to check if a parent element has the .star class.\\ndocument.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;mouseover\\u0026#39;, function (event) { // Only run our code on .rating forms \\tvar star = event.target.closest(\\u0026#39;.star\\u0026#39;); var form = event.target.closest(\\u0026#39;.rating\\u0026#39;); if (!star || !form) return; }, false);  Highlight up to the hovered element The process of highlighting up to our hovered star is pretty much the same as highlighting up to the selected one.\\nWe\\u0026rsquo;ll use getAttribute() on our star to get the hovered star index, and parseInt() to convert it to an integer. We\\u0026rsquo;ll use querySelectorAll() on the form to get all stars in that .ratings form.\\nFinally, we\\u0026rsquo;ll loop over each one with forEach() and compare it\\u0026rsquo;s index against the hovered star index, adding or removing the .selected class as needed.\\ndocument.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;mouseover\\u0026#39;, function (event) { // Only run our code on .rating forms \\tvar star = event.target.closest(\\u0026#39;.star\\u0026#39;); var form = event.target.closest(\\u0026#39;.rating\\u0026#39;); if (!star || !form) return; // Get the selected star \\tvar selectedIndex = parseInt(star.getAttribute(\\u0026#39;data-star\\u0026#39;), 10); // Get all stars in this form (only search in the form, not the whole document) \\t// Convert them from a node list to an array \\t// https://gomakethings.com/converting-a-nodelist-to-an-array-with-vanilla-javascript/ \\tvar stars = Array.from(form.querySelectorAll(\\u0026#39;.star\\u0026#39;)); // Loop through each star, and add or remove the `.selected` class to toggle highlighting \\tstars.forEach(function (star, index) { if (index \\u0026lt; selectedIndex) { // Selected star or before it \\t// Add highlighting \\tstar.classList.add(\\u0026#39;selected\\u0026#39;); } else { // After selected star \\t// Remove highlight \\tstar.classList.remove(\\u0026#39;selected\\u0026#39;); } }); }, false);  Not bad!\\nNow let\\u0026rsquo;s add the same feature for focus events, too.\\nHighlighting the focused star The great news here is that we can use the same exact function on focus events.\\nTo avoid writing the same code twice, let\\u0026rsquo;s pull the function out of our mouseover event into a standalone function.\\n// Highlight the hovered or focused star var highlight = function (event) { // Only run our code on .rating forms \\tvar star = event.target.closest(\\u0026#39;.star\\u0026#39;); var form = event.target.closest(\\u0026#39;.rating\\u0026#39;); if (!star || !form) return; // Get the selected star \\tvar selectedIndex = parseInt(star.getAttribute(\\u0026#39;data-star\\u0026#39;), 10); // Get all stars in this form (only search in the form, not the whole document) \\t// Convert them from a node list to an array \\t// https://gomakethings.com/converting-a-nodelist-to-an-array-with-vanilla-javascript/ \\tvar stars = Array.from(form.querySelectorAll(\\u0026#39;.star\\u0026#39;)); // Loop through each star, and add or remove the `.selected` class to toggle highlighting \\tstars.forEach(function (star, index) { if (index \\u0026lt; selectedIndex) { // Selected star or before it \\t// Add highlighting \\tstar.classList.add(\\u0026#39;selected\\u0026#39;); } else { // After selected star \\t// Remove highlight \\tstar.classList.remove(\\u0026#39;selected\\u0026#39;); } }); };  Now, we can run that function both mouseover and focus events. The event is automatically passed in as an argument.\\nBy default, focus events don\\u0026rsquo;t bubble, but if we pass in true for useCapture, the last argument in addEventListener(), we can get event bubbling for the event.\\n// Listen for hover and focus events on stars document.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;mouseover\\u0026#39;, highlight, false); document.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;focus\\u0026#39;, highlight, true);  Excellent!\\nYou can find the full source code for this on GitHub.\\nOne small problem There\\u0026rsquo;s one small problem, though: this removes highlighting when a star is already selected.\\nFor Friday, try to figure out how to reset the highlighting for the selected star, if one exists, or remove all highlighting if nothing has been selected yet.\\n\",\"summary\":\"Last week, we built a star-based rating system with vanilla JavaScript.\\nAs a follow-up challenge, I asked you to highlight stars on hover and focus so that user can see what their selection would look like.

In the HTML spec, they have no defined meaning, which makes them incredibly flexible.\\nAnd since they can be targeted with JavaScript using querySelector() and querySelectorAll(), it also makes them perfect for JavaScript selection.\\nThere are two approaches to this.

Make it look different from the other stars, and add some text for visually impaired users so that they know which star is selected, too.\\n Today, I want to share some of the solutions provided by other readers, and walk you through how I would approach it.\\nWhat others did View source any of these to dig into the code.\\nDave Buchholz sent me this working demo. On click, he\\u0026rsquo;s checking to see if a .star was clicked, then looping through all of them and adding the .selected class to items before and up to the selected star.\\nMaxx Heth sent me this approach. He applies styling on hover, too, and included an undo button.\\nAnd Paul Allen sent me this example on CodePen. He also added hover styling, and you can update your selection by clicking another star.\\nHow I approached this Let me start this off by saying that there are no right or wrong approaches here.\\nThere are approaches that are better, in the sense that they use less code, are easier to maintain, or run more efficiently. But other approaches are not wrong. The way I\\u0026rsquo;d approach this is highly opinionated.\\nUsing what the browser gives you For bonus points, I issued a challenge:\\n Make it also work if a keyboard-only user uses the tab key to move over to their desired rating and hits enter instead of using a mouse.\\n Instead of listening for when the button is clicked, I listen for submit events. This will capture both clicks, since clicking the button submits the .rating form, and someone hitting the enter key after tabbing over to their desired button.\\nThis allows you to capture both approaches with one listener.\\nI\\u0026rsquo;ll listen for all form submissions on the document (in case there are several rating forms), and check to make sure the event.target has the .rating class. If it does, I\\u0026rsquo;ll stop it from submitting with event.preventDefault(). Otherwise, I\\u0026rsquo;ll bail.\\n// Listen for form submissions document.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;submit\\u0026#39;, function (event) { // Only run our code on .rating forms \\tif (!event.target.matches(\\u0026#39;.rating\\u0026#39;)) return; // Prevent form from submitting \\tevent.preventDefault(); }, false);  Getting the selected star With a click event listener, you the event.listener is the selected star.\\nWith a form submission, it\\u0026rsquo;s the form itself. To get the clicked or entered star, we instead to need to see find the element on the page that\\u0026rsquo;s current in focus (since clicking on the button also brings it into focus) with the document.activeElement property.\\nI like to double check that there\\u0026rsquo;s an element in focus, and if there is, I\\u0026rsquo;ll use the getAttribute() method to get the [data-star] attribute value, which tells us the rating. Then I convert that from a string into an integer with the parseInt() function.\\n// Listen for form submissions document.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;submit\\u0026#39;, function (event) { // Only run our code on .rating forms \\tif (!event.target.matches(\\u0026#39;.rating\\u0026#39;)) return; // Prevent form from submitting \\tevent.preventDefault(); // Get the selected star \\tvar selected = document.activeElement; if (!selected) return; var selectedIndex = parseInt(selected.getAttribute(\\u0026#39;data-star\\u0026#39;), 10); }, false);  Highlighting our selected star I like to rely on CSS for styling whenever possible, so I added a .star.selected class to change the color of our selected star.\\n.star.selected { color: gold; } I could just apply that class to the selected element, but I also issued this challenge:\\n Highlight all of the stars before the selected one, too. For example, if you click the third star, stars one and two should also look different.\\n To make that work, we need to grab every star in our rating form and loop through them. To only get stars from the submitted form, we\\u0026rsquo;ll run querySelectorAll() on our event.target instead of the document.\\nThen, we\\u0026rsquo;ll use Array.from() to convert it from a NodeList into an array so I can use newer array methods like forEach() on it.\\n// Listen for form submissions document.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;submit\\u0026#39;, function (event) { // Only run our code on .rating forms \\tif (!event.target.matches(\\u0026#39;.rating\\u0026#39;)) return; // Prevent form from submitting \\tevent.preventDefault(); // Get the selected star \\tvar selected = document.activeElement; if (!selected) return; var selectedIndex = parseInt(selected.getAttribute(\\u0026#39;data-star\\u0026#39;), 10); // Get all stars in this form (only search in the form, not the whole document) \\t// Convert them from a node list to an array \\t// https://gomakethings.com/converting-a-nodelist-to-an-array-with-vanilla-javascript/ \\tvar stars = Array.from(event.target.querySelectorAll(\\u0026#39;.star\\u0026#39;)); }, false);  Looping through all of the stars Now, I\\u0026rsquo;ll use Array.forEach() to loop through the stars, passing in arguments for both the star and its index in the array.\\nIf the index (which starts at 0, not 1) is lower than the selectedIndex, the item is either the selected star or before it, so I\\u0026rsquo;ll add the .selected class. Otherwise, I\\u0026rsquo;ll remove it.\\n// Listen for form submissions document.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;submit\\u0026#39;, function (event) { // Only run our code on .rating forms \\tif (!event.target.matches(\\u0026#39;.rating\\u0026#39;)) return; // Prevent form from submitting \\tevent.preventDefault(); // Get the selected star \\tvar selected = document.activeElement; if (!selected) return; var selectedIndex = parseInt(selected.getAttribute(\\u0026#39;data-star\\u0026#39;), 10); // Get all stars in this form (only search in the form, not the whole document) \\t// Convert them from a node list to an array \\t// https://gomakethings.com/converting-a-nodelist-to-an-array-with-vanilla-javascript/ \\tvar stars = Array.from(event.target.querySelectorAll(\\u0026#39;.star\\u0026#39;)); // Loop through each star, and add or remove the `.selected` class to toggle highlighting \\tstars.forEach(function (star, index) { if (index \\u0026lt; selectedIndex) { // Selected star or before it \\t// Add highlighting \\tstar.classList.add(\\u0026#39;selected\\u0026#39;); } else { // After selected star \\t// Remove highlight \\tstar.classList.remove(\\u0026#39;selected\\u0026#39;); } }); }, false);  Now, we\\u0026rsquo;ve got a form that we\\u0026rsquo;ll highlight the selected star with a mouse or keyboard, and lets you change your rating.\\nWe\\u0026rsquo;re almost done.\\nAccessibility for visually impaired users One important part of this script is that visually impaired users need to know which star is selected, since they can\\u0026rsquo;t see the highlighted color.\\nI had originally suggested:\\n add some text for visually impaired users so that they know which star is selected, too.\\n My friend and accessibility expert Scott O\\u0026rsquo;Hara reached out to me and suggested I instead use the aria-pressed attribute. This role is specific to buttons, and indicates whether it\\u0026rsquo;s pressed or not.\\nTo do this, I\\u0026rsquo;ll first locate any previously selected star by looking for [aria-pressed=\\u0026quot;true\\u0026quot;] inside our event.target. If one exists, I\\u0026rsquo;ll remove the role. Then I\\u0026rsquo;ll add it to our selected element.\\n// Listen for form submissions document.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;submit\\u0026#39;, function (event) { // Only run our code on .rating forms \\tif (!event.target.matches(\\u0026#39;.rating\\u0026#39;)) return; // Prevent form from submitting \\tevent.preventDefault(); // Get the selected star \\tvar selected = document.activeElement; if (!selected) return; var selectedIndex = parseInt(selected.getAttribute(\\u0026#39;data-star\\u0026#39;), 10); // Get all stars in this form (only search in the form, not the whole document) \\t// Convert them from a node list to an array \\t// https://gomakethings.com/converting-a-nodelist-to-an-array-with-vanilla-javascript/ \\tvar stars = Array.from(event.target.querySelectorAll(\\u0026#39;.star\\u0026#39;)); // Loop through each star, and add or remove the `.selected` class to toggle highlighting \\tstars.forEach(function (star, index) { if (index \\u0026lt; selectedIndex) { // Selected star or before it \\t// Add highlighting \\tstar.classList.add(\\u0026#39;selected\\u0026#39;); } else { // After selected star \\t// Remove highlight \\tstar.classList.remove(\\u0026#39;selected\\u0026#39;); } }); // Remove aria-pressed from any previously selected star \\tvar previousRating = event.target.querySelector(\\u0026#39;.star[aria-pressed=\\u0026#34;true\\u0026#34;]\\u0026#39;); if (previousRating) { previousRating.removeAttribute(\\u0026#39;aria-pressed\\u0026#39;); } // Add aria-pressed role to the selected button \\tselected.setAttribute(\\u0026#39;aria-pressed\\u0026#39;, true); }, false);  Scott also pointed out that with our current setup, assistive technology like Voice Over will read \\u0026ldquo;Black Star\\u0026rdquo; on each button because of the icon we\\u0026rsquo;ve used.\\nYou can avoid this by using something like an SVG icon instead, or you can wrap the item in a span with the aria-hidden=\\u0026quot;true\\u0026quot; attribute.\\n\\u0026lt;button type=\\u0026#34;submit\\u0026#34; class=\\u0026#34;star\\u0026#34; data-star=\\u0026#34;1\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;span aria-hidden=\\u0026#34;true\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;\\u0026amp;#9733;\\u0026lt;/span\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;span class=\\u0026#34;screen-reader\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;1 Star\\u0026lt;/span\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;/button\\u0026gt; Now we\\u0026rsquo;re officially done.

You could do this.\\n\\u0026lt;div data-content=\\u0026#34;Some content goes here.\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt; And in your CSS, you do this.\\n[data-content]:before { content: attr(data-content); } Here\\u0026rsquo;s a demo of it in action.\\nWith this example, that content is better served in the markup itself. But when you need to use the content property and want dynamic content, this is a cool way to do it.\\nA quick accessibility note: some screenreader/browser combos do not read text rendered with content, so critical content should always go in the markup.\\nBrowser Compatibility Both attribute selectors and the attr() function work in all major browsers. Attribute selectors also work back to IE7, while the attr() function works in IE8 and up.\\n\",\"summary\":\"I use data attributes all the time in my JavaScript.

This is possible because innerHTML renders complete markup and not just text.\\nThere is one built-in safeguard in place, though. Just injecting a script element won\\u0026rsquo;t expose you to attacks, because the section of the DOM you\\u0026rsquo;re injecting into has already been parsed and run.\\n// This won\\u0026#39;t execute var div = document.querySelector(\\u0026#39;#some-div\\u0026#39;); div.innerHTML = \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;script\\u0026gt;alert(\\u0026#34;XSS Attack\\u0026#34;);\\u0026lt;/script\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39;;  JavaScript that runs at a later time, though, will.\\n// This WILL run div.innerHTML = \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;script deferred\\u0026gt;alert(\\u0026#34;XSS Attack\\u0026#34;);\\u0026lt;/script\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39;; // This will, too div.innerHTML = \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;img src=x onerror=\\u0026#34;alert(\\\\\\u0026#39;XSS Attack\\\\\\u0026#39;)\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39;;  When is this an issue If you\\u0026rsquo;re inject your own markup into a page, there\\u0026rsquo;s little cause for concern. The danger comes from injecting user and third-party markup into the DOM.\\nIf you\\u0026rsquo;re adding content to a page that you didn\\u0026rsquo;t write, you should sanitize it to protect yourself from XSS attacks.\\nLet\\u0026rsquo;s look at how.\\nA safe alternative to innerHTML One super easy approach: use textContent instead of innerHTML. This gets and injects only text content, not markup, from and into a DOM node.\\n// Renders a string with escaped characters // This would show up in the DOM as \\u0026lt;img src=x onerror=\\u0026#34;alert(\\u0026#39;XSS Attack\\u0026#39;)\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt; instead of as an image element div.textContent = \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;img src=x onerror=\\u0026#34;alert(\\\\\\u0026#39;XSS Attack\\\\\\u0026#39;)\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39;;  The textContent property works in all modern browsers, and IE9 and up.\\nSanitizing content before adding it to the DOM The textContent property is great if you\\u0026rsquo;re only adding text, but if you\\u0026rsquo;re adding some third-party content as part of some additional markup, you\\u0026rsquo;ll still want to use innerHTML.\\nTo make it safe, you\\u0026rsquo;ll need to sanitize the content (that is, remove disallowed markup) before injecting it.\\nIf the third-party code is not allowed to contain any markup, you can use a helper method to remove markup from the code.\\n/*! * Sanitize and encode all HTML in a user-submitted string * (c) 2018 Chris Ferdinandi, MIT License, https://gomakethings.com * @param {String} str The user-submitted string * @return {String} str The sanitized string */ var sanitizeHTML = function (str) { var temp = document.createElement(\\u0026#39;div\\u0026#39;); temp.textContent = str; return temp.innerHTML; };  This works by creating a temporary div and adding the content with textContent to escape any characters. It then returns them using innerHTML to prevent those escaped characters from transforming back into unescaped markup.\\n// Renders \\u0026lt;h1\\u0026gt;\\u0026amp;lt;img src=x onerror=\\u0026#34;alert(\\u0026#39;XSS Attack\\u0026#39;)\\u0026#34;\\u0026amp;gt;\\u0026lt;/h1\\u0026gt; div.innerHTML = \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;h1\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39; + sanitizeHTML(\\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;img src=x onerror=\\u0026#34;alert(\\\\\\u0026#39;XSS Attack\\\\\\u0026#39;)\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39;) + \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;/h1\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39;;  If the third-party content is allowed to contain markup, a helper library like DOMPurify will remove any markup that\\u0026rsquo;s not part of a secure whitelist before injecting it.\\n\",\"summary\":\"I generally use innerHTML to inject HTML into an element with vanilla JavaScript.\\nYesterday, one of my students asked me about the danger of cross-site scripting (XSS) when using this property.

Let\\u0026rsquo;s look at an example.\\nvar sandwiches = [ \\u0026#39;tuna\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;ham\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;turkey\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;pb\\u0026amp;j\\u0026#39; ]; for (var i = 0; i \\u0026lt; sandwiches.length; i++) { console.log(i); // index \\tconsole.log(sandwiches[i]); // value } // returns 0, \\u0026#34;tuna\\u0026#34;, 1, \\u0026#34;ham\\u0026#34;, 2, \\u0026#34;turkey\\u0026#34;, 3, \\u0026#34;pb\\u0026amp;j\\u0026#34;  For our initialization, we\\u0026rsquo;re setting up a counter variable. After each loop, we\\u0026rsquo;ll increase this by one, and use it to know which item in our array we\\u0026rsquo;re currently looking at in the loop.\\nIn the condition, we\\u0026rsquo;ll make sure that our counter variable is smaller than the total number of items in our array. If it\\u0026rsquo;s not, we\\u0026rsquo;ve looped through the whole array and can end the loop.\\nFinally, in our finalExpression, which runs after each iteration of the loop, we\\u0026rsquo;ll add 1 to our counter variable (i).\\nInside the loop, we can use the i variable to get the current item in the loop from our array, like this.\\nsandwiches[i];  Quick aside: Ever wonder what the difference between a NodeList and an array is? One is a JavaScript object. The other is actually part of the Browser API. Learn more about the difference between the two here.\\nfor loop performance In the condition, we check the length of array or NodeList against i.\\nAs an old best practice, people recommended caching that length into a variable so that the loop wouldn\\u0026rsquo;t have to recalculate it on each iteration.\\n// This isn\\u0026#39;t necessary for (var i = 0, len = sandwiches.length; i \\u0026lt; len; i++) { console.log(i); // index \\tconsole.log(sandwiches[i]); // value }  For similar reasons, you\\u0026rsquo;ll also see people sometimes write loops that run backwards, setting i to the last item and working to 0.\\n// This isn\\u0026#39;t necessary either for (var i = sandwiches.length - 1; i \\u0026gt;= 0; i--) { console.log(i); // index \\tconsole.log(sandwiches[i]); // value }  Browser eventually figured this out, and started caching the length of loops for you behind the scenes, whether you do it or not.\\nCache the length or don\\u0026rsquo;t cache the length. It doesn\\u0026rsquo;t really matter.\\nBrowser Compatibility The for loop works in all modern browsers, and at least back to IE6.\\nTomorrow, we\\u0026rsquo;ll look at a variation of the for loop: the for...in loop.\\n\",\"summary\":\"This week, we\\u0026rsquo;re going to back to basics.

I went and grabbed some dummy text from the Pirate Ipsum website, and added it to a div with the .truncate class.\\nYou can use any selector you\\u0026rsquo;d like. Just make sure there\\u0026rsquo;s a way to target the content to truncate.\\n\\u0026lt;div class=\\u0026#34;truncate\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt; Port tender gun spanker lanyard heave to topmast. Heave down draught piracy loaded to the gunwalls mizzenmast topsail Brethren of the Coast. Lanyard snow Jack Ketch swing the lead maroon spike black jack. \\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt; Creating a truncate() function Let\\u0026rsquo;s setup a truncate() function, and pass in two arguments.\\nThe first, elem, will be the element whose content we want to truncate. The second, limit, will be the number of words to truncate the content by. If either of those is missing, we\\u0026rsquo;ll end the function.\\nvar truncate = function (elem, limit) { // Make sure an element and number of items to truncate is provided \\tif (!elem || !limit) return; };  If we, for example, wanted to limit our .truncate content to just seven words, we would do this.\\nvar elem = document.querySelector(\\u0026#39;.truncate\\u0026#39;); truncate(elem, 7);  Truncating the content Next, we need a way to get the content from our element.\\nI often use innerHTML for this sort of thing, but we only want the text, not the markup. If we, for example, got content that had an opening div element, and split it before the closing element, we could cause layout issues.\\nFor this, we\\u0026rsquo;ll use the textContent property. Let\\u0026rsquo;s also remove any leading or trailing whitespace with the trim() method.\\nvar truncate = function (elem, limit) { // Make sure an element and number of items to truncate is provided \\tif (!elem || !limit) return; // Get the inner content of the element \\tvar content = elem.textContent.trim(); };  Now we\\u0026rsquo;re ready to truncate our content.\\nTo do this, we\\u0026rsquo;ll convert our string of text into an array, with each word as it\\u0026rsquo;s own item. We\\u0026rsquo;ll use the split() method, passing in a space as the character to split our string by.\\nvar truncate = function (elem, limit) { // Make sure an element and number of items to truncate is provided \\tif (!elem || !limit) return; // Get the inner content of the element \\tvar content = elem.textContent.trim(); // Convert the content into an array of words \\tcontent = content.split(\\u0026#39; \\u0026#39;); console.log(content); };  If you logged content into the console, you would get back an array of words. See it in action here.\\nThe .slice() method lets you create a new array, that\\u0026rsquo;s a subset of another one. It accepts two arguments. The first is where to start, and the second is where to end.\\nWe\\u0026rsquo;ll pass in 0 as the starting point to start with the first word. We\\u0026rsquo;ll pass in our limit argument as the ending point. We can chain this method to the split() method to keep the code smaller.\\nvar truncate = function (elem, limit) { // Make sure an element and number of items to truncate is provided \\tif (!elem || !limit) return; // Get the inner content of the element \\tvar content = elem.textContent.trim(); // Convert the content into an array of words \\t// Remove any words above the limit \\tcontent = content.split(\\u0026#39; \\u0026#39;).slice(0, limit); console.log(content); };  If you log content to the console now, you\\u0026rsquo;ll notice it only has seven items instead of the original 33. Here\\u0026rsquo;s an updated demo.\\nInjecting our truncated content back into the DOM Now that we\\u0026rsquo;ve truncated our content, we need to add it back into the DOM.\\nWe\\u0026rsquo;ll convert it back into a string using the join() method, which combines array items into a string. We\\u0026rsquo;ll pass in a space as a delimiter (what it will add between each item).\\nvar truncate = function (elem, limit) { // Make sure an element and number of items to truncate is provided \\tif (!elem || !limit) return; // Get the inner content of the element \\tvar content = elem.textContent.trim(); // Convert the content into an array of words \\t// Remove any words above the limit \\tcontent = content.split(\\u0026#39; \\u0026#39;).slice(0, limit); // Convert the array of words back into a string \\tcontent = content.join(\\u0026#39; \\u0026#39;); };  Now we can inject it back into the DOM with the same textContent property we used to get our content.\\nvar truncate = function (elem, limit) { // Make sure an element and number of items to truncate is provided \\tif (!elem || !limit) return; // Get the inner content of the element \\tvar content = elem.textContent.trim(); // Convert the content into an array of words \\t// Remove any words above the limit \\tcontent = content.split(\\u0026#39; \\u0026#39;).slice(0, limit); // Convert the array of words back into a string \\tcontent = content.join(\\u0026#39; \\u0026#39;); // Inject the content back into the DOM \\telem.textContent = content; };  Here\\u0026rsquo;s a demo with our new truncated content.\\nAdding trailing characters There\\u0026rsquo;s on weird thing about our new truncated content: it ends abruptly. Ideally, we would add some characters after it to indicate that it\\u0026rsquo;s been truncated, like ellipsis (...);\\nLet\\u0026rsquo;s add one more optional argument to our function: after.\\nIf it exists, we\\u0026rsquo;ll append our newly joined content with. Otherwise, we\\u0026rsquo;ll just append an empty string. I\\u0026rsquo;ll be using a ternary operator to keep the code a bit more compact.\\nvar truncate = function (elem, limit, after) { // Make sure an element and number of items to truncate is provided \\tif (!elem || !limit) return; // Get the inner content of the element \\tvar content = elem.textContent.trim(); // Convert the content into an array of words \\t// Remove any words above the limit \\tcontent = content.split(\\u0026#39; \\u0026#39;).slice(0, limit); // Convert the array of words back into a string \\t// If there\\u0026#39;s content to add after it, add it \\tcontent = content.join(\\u0026#39; \\u0026#39;) + (after ? after : \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;); // Inject the content back into the DOM \\telem.textContent = content; };  Now we can truncate our content like this.\\nvar elem = document.querySelector(\\u0026#39;.truncate\\u0026#39;); truncate(elem, 7, \\u0026#39;...\\u0026#39;);  Here\\u0026rsquo;s a demo of the final script in action.\\nBrowser Compatibility The textContent and trim() method both require IE9 or higher.\\nThere\\u0026rsquo;s a polyfill for trim() that pushes support back to at least IE6.

In others, you use document.documentElement.clientWidth.\\nCombine them for maximum browser support.\\nvar viewportWidth = window.innerWidth || document.documentElement.clientWidth;  We can then do things conditionally based on the width.\\nFor example, let\\u0026rsquo;s log Wide viewport into the console if the width is greater than 640px, and Small viewport if it\\u0026rsquo;s smaller than that.\\nvar viewportWidth = window.innerWidth || document.documentElement.clientWidth; if (viewportWidth \\u0026gt; 640) { console.log(\\u0026#39;Wide viewport\\u0026#39;); } else { console.log(\\u0026#39;Small viewport\\u0026#39;); }  Here\\u0026rsquo;s a demo.

For performance reasons, you should debounce the event listener, but I won\\u0026rsquo;t be doing that here to keep the example easier to read.\\nvar viewportWidth = window.innerWidth || document.documentElement.clientWidth; if (viewportWidth \\u0026gt; 640) { console.log(\\u0026#39;Wide viewport\\u0026#39;); } else { console.log(\\u0026#39;Small viewport\\u0026#39;); } window.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;resize\\u0026#39;, function () { viewportWidth = window.innerWidth || document.documentElement.clientWidth; if (viewportWidth \\u0026gt; 640) { console.log(\\u0026#39;Wide viewport\\u0026#39;); } else { console.log(\\u0026#39;Small viewport\\u0026#39;); } }, false);  Here\\u0026rsquo;s an updated demo.

For me, old fashioned floats with a simple percentage-based grid works just fine.\\nI particularly like Frank\\u0026rsquo;s take on it\\u0026hellip;\\n And now, after flexing with flexbox, along comes CSS Grid: a powerful new feature that promises to make responsive web design even more confusing.

But it is a bit spooky to sit down and learn more about it, because every time I see a diagram explaining how CSS Grid works\\u0026hellip;\\nI’m reminded of the table layouts I was doing in 1997.

It was easy to back away from most of this new stuff when I realized I have alternate ways of managing complexity. Instead of changing my tools or workflow, I change my design.

Exporting content out of WordPress. Importing content into Hugo. Cleaning up the content to remove \\u0026ldquo;legacy\\u0026rdquo; WordPress cruft.  Let\\u0026rsquo;s dig in!\\n1. Porting my theme The Go Make Things theme was one I hand-coded on top of Elliot Jay Stocks now unmaintained Starkers theme boilerplate.\\nAs the name implies, it\\u0026rsquo;s a relatively bare theme (no CSS at all) designed to provide a starting point for projects.\\nI wanted to start fresh with a cleaned up code base on Hugo, so I dug through the minimal themes from their repository and tried a few, but kept hitting roadblocks.\\nI instead ended up using the Ananke theme that\\u0026rsquo;s used in the Quick Start guide. I ripped out all of the markup, stylesheets, and graphics, and instead used it as a foundation for how to structure templates.\\nI grabbed the latest version of Kraken, my front end boilerplate, and recoded my theme. I borrowed some code from the old site along the way as needed, but generally worked off the new code base instead.\\n2. Exporting content out of WordPress There\\u0026rsquo;s a WordPress to Hugo exporter plugin, but it doesn\\u0026rsquo;t work (others have reported issues as well).\\nFortunately, the formatting for Jekyll content is nearly identical, so I used the Jekyll Exporter plugin, which creates a zip file of all of your posts, pages, and custom post types, as well as the contents of your wp-content/uploads directory with all of your images and such.\\nThis is the easiest part of the whole process.\\n3. Importing content into Hugo Some of my content, like my About page and the sales pages for my pocket guides and mini courses, I manually copy-pasted into new files and cleaned up a bit.\\nWith my blog posts, I just drag-and-dropped the whole set of files into my /posts directory in Hugo.\\nThe front matter at the top of each post is more or less ready to use in Hugo. I wrote most of my WordPress posts in markdown thanks to the Jetpack plugin, but even if your content uses HTML, that\\u0026rsquo;s valid for markdown files, too, so no need to convert anything over.\\n4. Cleaning up the content This step is optional, but I\\u0026rsquo;m nuts about my content, so\\u0026hellip;\\nNote: This is way easier with a full-featured text editor like Sublime Text or VS Code. If you can, I\\u0026rsquo;d recommend Sublime, which has multiline regex (Code does not).\\nThe front matter from the Jekyll export includes some stuff that\\u0026rsquo;s just not needed in Hugo.\\n---id:15112title:MakingiteasiertoselectelementswithvanillaJavaScriptdate:2017-08-07T09:00:00+00:00author:ChrisFerdinandilayout:postguid:/?p=15112permalink:/making-it-easier-to-select-elements-with-vanilla-javascript/categories:-Code-JavaScript--- Specifically, id, layout, guid, and, in my case, author can all go.\\nIn Sublime, you can do a find-and-replace across all files in a directory (command+shift+f on MacOS). I used regex matching, like this: id: .*, and included the line break in my search to remove the line entirely from all of my posts.\\nUnder File in Sublime, there\\u0026rsquo;s also a Save All feature that will save you a ton of headaches saving all of your changes (I have hundreds of posts from 6 years of regular writing on this site).\\nWhile permalink is a valid front matter variable, I prefer url, so I did a find-and-replace on permalink:, replacing it with url:.\\nOther issues: shortcodes in my content. I didn\\u0026rsquo;t have a ton, but I had created a plugin for reusing content across articles (calls to action and things like that). I did a find-and-replace on that as well.\\nOne other issue was WordPress\\u0026rsquo;s [caption] shortcode. I hadn\\u0026rsquo;t used that much and didn\\u0026rsquo;t want to both with regex pattern matching on it, so I searched for files using it and manually fixed them.\\nHow to preserve links to your old images Rather than migrating images into a new structure, I drag-and-dropped the entire wp-content directory from my Jekyll Exporter plugin file into the static directory in Hugo.\\nIt gets copied as-is into my website root, preserving links to all of my old images. Going forward, I use a new directory structure, but this was the easiest way to keep the old stuff without breaking anything.\\nI did, however, go through and delete a bunch of duplicate images, PDFs, and other large files. I also ran the entire directory through ImageOptim to reduce the overall footprint.\\nAnd that\\u0026rsquo;s it! Theming the new site probably took longer than anything, because I\\u0026rsquo;m not terribly familiar with GoLang (which powers Hugo\\u0026rsquo;s templating features) and had to Google a bunch of stuff.\\nThe actual migration took me about a day, in large part due to some trial and error. Doing it again today, it would take a couple of hours.\\nIn future articles, I\\u0026rsquo;m going to look at how to customize your RSS feed, add search to static websites, and how to generate dynamic content on a static site.\\nIf there\\u0026rsquo;s anything else you\\u0026rsquo;d like to learn about, get in touch and let me know!\\n\",\"summary\":\"A couple of weeks ago, I moved this site over from WordPress to Hugo, a static site generator.\\nI\\u0026rsquo;ve written a little bit about why I made the switch, how I automated deployment of my site, and how I\\u0026rsquo;m able to automatically publish prescheduled posts at the right time.\\nToday, I wanted to talk about something a bunch of people have asked me about: how to actually migrate content from WordPress into Hugo.\",\"title\":\"Migrating From Wordpress to Hugo\",\"url\":\"https://gomakethings.com/migrating-from-wordpress-to-hugo/\"},{\"categories\":[\"Code\",\"JavaScript\"],\"content\":\"This week I learned a super handy debugging trick: console.table().\\nDebugging often involves logging a bunch of stuff in the console until you find the thing that\\u0026rsquo;s not working the way you\\u0026rsquo;d expect.

Netlify provides a free SSL certificate for you.\\nHow to schedule posts with a static website In Hugo (and Jekyll and most other static generators), you can set a publish date and time.\\nWhen Hugo runs its build, it only creates HTML files for content that has a publish date for sometime at or before the current date and time (as in, future-dated stuff won\\u0026rsquo;t get built).\\nAll that work we did yesterday to have our server run our build? It\\u0026rsquo;s going to come in really handy now.\\nScheduling builds on our server We can tell our server to run a fresh build at set intervals.\\nYou might rebuild your site files once a day. Or twice. Or once an hour. This is on top of the automatic rebuilding that happens when you push an update to GitHub.\\nFor example, I publish a new article each day at 10:30am. I can tell my server to run a new build every hour at the 40 minute mark. When it does, any article whose publish date is now in the past gets created and goes live on the site.\\nTo do this, we need to set up what\\u0026rsquo;s called a cron job.\\nCreating a cron job Log in to your server, and run crontab -e.\\nThis will pull up an editor where you can configure your cron jobs. Cron jobs follow this pattern:\\n\\u0026lt;minute\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;hour\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;day of the month\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;month\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;day of the week\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;commands to run\\u0026gt; For example, this would run a command every minute:\\n* * * * * And this would run a command on the 31st minute of every hour:\\n31 * * * * This would run a command at 10:30am every day:\\n30 10 * * * On my server, I want to run a fresh build on the 31 minute mark of every hour.

You open an app in your browser, write, and hit publish.\\nI dreaded the idea of having to open an FTP client and push static files up to a server. And while I don\\u0026rsquo;t often make updates from my phone or while traveling, I didn\\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of needing my laptop to make updates.\\nThen Zach Leatherman, creator of Eleventy, tipped me off to automatic deployments. It was a game changer.\\nToday, I want to show you how I set that up (your setup may differ depending on hosting).\\nHow does automatic deployment work? After I make updates, I push my changes to GitHub.\\nI use command line, but they also have a fantastic GUI, and there are some great third party options and text editor integrations you could use instead, too.\\nWhenever I push an update in my websites master branch in GitHub, it notifies my server through something called a webhook. My server pulls the latest version of my site from GitHub, runs a Hugo build, and moves the built files into my live site directory.\\nA side benefit: GitHub is now a web GUI for my content Let\\u0026rsquo;s say I\\u0026rsquo;m away from my laptop and I need to make an update or someone notices a bug on my site.\\nI can now open the content file on GitHub.com from any browser and make my updates. As soon as I commit and push the file, it triggers a rebuild and automatically updates the site.\\nThe easy way If you have really basic needs for your new static site, I cannot recommend Netlify enough.\\nWhen you setup your site, you give them access to your GitHub site. They automatically configure the integration I described above for you.\\nThey also offer a more proper CMS for managing your content. Unlike a traditional CMS that communicates with a database, they use the GitHub API to pull and modify your content (I think).\\nThe hard way (what I do) I have some custom server things I need to do, so I do things the hard way.\\nThis does require some command line skills in addition to using an FTP client, so it might not be the best approach if command line isn\\u0026rsquo;t your thing.\\n0. Hosting environment I use DigitalOcean (get $10 in credits to try them with that link) for my hosting, and ServerPilot to automate setting up apps, handle my tech stack and security layer, and automate domain routing.\\nYour server environment might work a bit different from mine, so just be aware that these instructions are specific to how DigitalOcean is set up.\\n1. Install Hugo on the server I followed DigitalOcean\\u0026rsquo;s instructions for installing Hugo.\\nTheir tutorial includes a very old version of Hugo. Make sure you grab the latest version from their releases page instead.\\n# DON\\u0026#39;T use this wget https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases/download/v0.14/hugo_0.14_amd64.deb # Use something LIKE this instead wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.34/hugo_0.34_Linux-64bit.deb Quick heads up: the first time I did this, I read quickly and thought ARM said AMD, so I downloaded the wrong file.\\nIt caused some\\u0026hellip; annoying to fix conflicts and I had to remove things and start over, and that was uncomfortable for me since I\\u0026rsquo;m a command line novice and terrified of screwing up my server.\\nRead carefully.\\n2a. UPDATE: Add an SSH key to your server In order to complete the next step\\u0026mdash;cloning your GitHub repository to your server\\u0026mdash;you need to setup an SSH key on the server.\\nTo do that, run ssh-keygen. It will ask you to add a passcode, if desired. You can just leave it blank.\\nNext, run cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to print the public key into the terminal window. Copy the output, then head over to your account settings in GitHub.\\nUnder the \\u0026ldquo;SSH and GPG keys\\u0026rdquo; section, click \\u0026ldquo;New SSH key\\u0026rdquo; and paste in the output from the terminal window. Then click \\u0026ldquo;Save.\\u0026rdquo; Your server now has permission to speak to GitHub on your behalf.\\n2. Clone your GitHub repository Move into the directory for your app. On DigitalOcean, that looks like this (replace \\u0026lt;MY_APP_NAME\\u0026gt; with your apps actual name):\\ncd apps/\\u0026lt;MY_APP_NAME\\u0026gt; Do not go into the /public directory.\\nNext, clone your GitHub repository for your site. Again, don\\u0026rsquo;t forget to change \\u0026lt;YOUR_USERNAME\\u0026gt; and \\u0026lt;YOUR_RESPOSITORY\\u0026gt;, respectively.\\ngit clone git@github.com:\\u0026lt;YOUR_USERNAME\\u0026gt;/\\u0026lt;YOUR_RESPOSITORY\\u0026gt;.git Finally, let\\u0026rsquo;s rename the new directory with your site in it to build.\\nmv \\u0026lt;YOUR_RESPOSITORY\\u0026gt; build 3. Add a deploy script Next, we\\u0026rsquo;re going to add a deploy script that will automatically pull the latest build and run Hugo whenever we push updates to GitHub.\\nCreate a new file on your computer called deploy.php, and add this code to it.

The easiest way is with an FTP client.\\n4. Create a secret To keep this process and file secure, you should setup a secret that GitHub will use to encrypt the webhook.\\nGenerate a random string. I used my password manager for this, but there are online tools, too. Google random string generator to find one.\\nIf your app already has an .htaccess file setup, download it so you can edit it (it would be in the /public directory at the root level). If not, create one.\\nWe\\u0026rsquo;re going to add our GitHub secret to it as a server environment variable. Putting it directly in our deploy.php script would be insecure.\\nAdd this to your .htaccess file, and then upload it back to the /public directory, replacing \\u0026lt;YOUR_RANDOM_STRING\\u0026gt; with your random string. Make sure you save it somewhere for the next step.\\n# GitHub webhook secret SetEnv GH_DEPLOY_SECRET \\u0026lt;YOUR_RANDOM_STRING\\u0026gt; 5. Setup a GitHub webhook Next, go to the settings for your GitHub repository and select Webhooks from the left-hand menu. Click \\u0026ldquo;Add a webhook.\\u0026rdquo;\\nFor the Payload URL, using your domain + deploy.php.\\nhttp://example.com/deploy.php  Paste your random string into the Secret field, and click save. The defaults are fine for everything else.\\nGitHub will ping your script to make sure everything is setup correctly, and if it is, your first build and deploy will run automatically.\\nWhat now? If that worked for you, you can now make updates to your site, push to GitHub, and have the site automatically update itself.\\nYou never need to run a Hugo build locally on your computer (though you obviously can if you want to).\\nIf I missed anything, wasn\\u0026rsquo;t clear, of your have any questions, please hit reply and let me know.

I\\u0026rsquo;ve been a WordPress apologist supporter for a long time.\\nA lot of the bad performance of WordPress sites is caused by poorly written plugins and some default behaviors of the CMS. These can be worked around.\\nI made a habit of disabling JS files that plugins were loading on pages where they weren\\u0026rsquo;t used, and forcing JavaScript to get loaded in the footer so it wouldn\\u0026rsquo;t block rendering.\\nI installed a plugin that pre-compiled HTML from my database and templates so that visitors wouldn\\u0026rsquo;t have to wait for them to get created on fly with each visit. I ended up writing a lot of my own plugins to avoid the cruft of what was available already.\\nAnd then I hit a breaking point.\\nWriting was taking forever. The WordPress dashboard had become unbearably slow. Every new plugin required another hack to remove unneeded files and maintain front end web performance.\\nI got tired of fighting the CMS defaults.\\nThe beauty of HTML Static site generators like Hugo, Jekyll, and new kid on the block Eleventy take a collection of content (usually in markdown files) and mash them up with template files, just like a traditional CMS would.\\nBut, unlike your traditional CMS, they do it ahead of time. You upload your simple HTML files to the server, and that\\u0026rsquo;s what gets loaded.\\nYou get the benefits of using a traditional CMS, with the simplicity and speed of static HTML.\\nThings that are difficult in WordPress are so easy in Hugo I used a lot of custom post types in WordPress.\\nSetting them up involves passing in a bunch of options through multiple PHP functions, ideally added via a plugin. Then I\\u0026rsquo;d need to create a PHP template for the post type layout, and make sure that any content was routed through the right template in my theme (it doesn\\u0026rsquo;t happen automatically).\\nIn Hugo, I create a folder named after the content type (for example, /talks), and add my content to it. If I want a custom template for it, I add one to the /layouts/talks folder. That\\u0026rsquo;s it! Hugo just figures it out.\\nIn WordPress, adding additional metadata and options to a post or page involved, again, multiple functions, calls to the database, sanitization to keep malicious code out, and so on.\\nIn Hugo, I add a key/value pair to the head of my content file, like this: talkLocation: \\u0026quot;Boston, MA\\u0026quot;. I can then access that in my template by using .Params.talkLocation. So simple!\\nI\\u0026rsquo;m no longer fighting the conventions of the CMS, or bad decisions made by plugin developers. If I want to load a JS file, I just add a \\u0026lt;script\\u0026gt; element.\\nIt\\u0026rsquo;s web development in its purest form.\\nChallenges and things I was worried about With WordPress, I made heavy use of scheduled posts. I\\u0026rsquo;d write them ahead of time and WP would post them automatically at a set time. I was worried about losing that.\\nThen Zach Leatherman taught me that you can actually let the server handle that for you with a static site generator, too.\\nI didn\\u0026rsquo;t want to have to push files up via FTP all the time. You can automate that, too.\\nI had a bunch of custom PHP stuff I was doing. I now have the option of still doing that, just outside of the WordPress environment (and thus faster), or using some simple third-party APIs and services instead.\\nI\\u0026rsquo;ll cover all of this in detail in future articles, but so far, it\\u0026rsquo;s been all upside.

I\\u0026rsquo;m talking blogs. Portfolio sites. Marketing micro-sites. They all stop working in some critical way.\\nCommon ways sites break without JavaScript The number one thing I see break without JavaScript is navigation, typically on smaller viewports, but sometimes on larger ones, too.\\nThat ubiquitous expand-and-collapse nav on mobile? It runs on JavaScript. No JavaScript means you\\u0026rsquo;re stuck on the homepage.\\nI\\u0026rsquo;ve also seen some sites where dropdown menus don\\u0026rsquo;t work without JavaScript. On one of them, the really weird part was that the dropdown was shown with a hover, but only when JavaScript was supported. You can power something like that with just CSS if you wanted to.\\nAnother big one, especially on ecommerce sites, is JavaScript-only checkout.\\nIf JavaScript is working, you get a fully functional checkout cart. If not, you get\\u0026hellip; a blank screen. Or a spinning loader that never stops. Or worst of all, a complete checkout form with the submit button disabled, so you only find out after you\\u0026rsquo;ve entered all of your info that you can\\u0026rsquo;t actually complete a purchase.\\nAnd since JavaScript is often used to show and hide things, you often see \\u0026ldquo;more details\\u0026hellip;\\u0026rdquo; links, tabbed content, and modal links with content hidden behind them that can never be accessed.\\nThese are all stupid problems that are cost you money and visitors, and (mostly) have some reasonably easy fixes.\\nWho cares? No one actually turns JavaScript off, anyways. There are some people who turn off JavaScript, but generally speaking, the days of disabling JavaScript on purpose are over.\\nThere are still tons of people who end up on your site without JavaScript, though. How does that happen?\\n The CDN you\\u0026rsquo;re serving your file from is having issues and fails. An overly aggressive ad blocker flags your script as an ad and blocks it (this one happens to me a lot with Ghostery). Your visitor is on a slower connection or older device, so while they\\u0026rsquo;re waiting, they have no JS and can\\u0026rsquo;t use your site (even though all of the content is already loaded and ready). Your visitor\\u0026rsquo;s connection is so slow that their browser times out your JavaScript file and never downloads it at all. They\\u0026rsquo;re commuting (on a train, bus, whatever) and hit a no-service zone halfway through loading your site. All of the content is loaded, but the JavaScript file isn\\u0026rsquo;t. Your visitor is using an older device or browser that doesn\\u0026rsquo;t support the JavaScript methods and browser APIs you\\u0026rsquo;re using. And no, they can\\u0026rsquo;t just \\u0026ldquo;download a new one\\u0026rdquo; because they\\u0026rsquo;re on a corporate computer or an old, crappy laptop they can\\u0026rsquo;t afford to upgrade. Their company\\u0026rsquo;s firewall blocks any external JavaScript files that\\u0026rsquo;s not whitelisted (I\\u0026rsquo;ve had this happen to me often, too).  There are a lot of reasons why a vistor might not have access to JavaScript, most of them beyond their control. Shouldn\\u0026rsquo;t that person be able to complete the core tasks on your site anyways?\\nSo\\u0026hellip; what can you do about it? The fix is pretty obvious: make sure your stuff works without JavaScript.\\nThis doesn\\u0026rsquo;t mean users without JavaScript get the same exact top-tier experience. It just means they can access all of the content and complete their core tasks. As Brad Frost says, support is not the same as optimization.\\nNavigation menus? Show all of the links as an inline list until the script loads, and then hide them behind the expand-and-collapse menu. I\\u0026rsquo;ve even seen some sites display them in the footer, with the menu button acting as an anchor link by default. Once JS is available, the menu moves off campus and the button works the way you\\u0026rsquo;d normally expect it to. (Check out the Financial Times for a great example of this.)\\nShow-and-hide widgets and tabbed menus? Show all of the content until your script loads and treat them like anchor links. Same goes for modals. Or, if you\\u0026rsquo;d prefer, you can host the modal content on another page and pull it asynchronously into the modal when someone clicks the link.\\nCheckout carts get a little bit harder, because Stripe is awesome, and requires JavaScript to work. If you really care about maximizing revenue, though, you should probably figure out a no-JavaScript server-side option as well.\\nThis sounds complicated It can be, because it forces you to think different about how you write your JavaScript.\\nAfter two or three projects, though, it becomes second nature, and sites that don\\u0026rsquo;t work without JavaScript will start to drive you nuts.\\n\",\"summary\":\"I\\u0026rsquo;ve been doing some research for an upcoming chat I\\u0026rsquo;m going to be having with Ethan Marcotte and Karen McGrane on how to write JavaScript that works for anyone on any device (and what to do when it doesn\\u0026rsquo;t).\\nI\\u0026rsquo;m amazed at how many sites break in some fundamental way when JavaScript isn\\u0026rsquo;t available.\\nI don\\u0026rsquo;t just mean immersive, interactive web applications.

Quite a few!\\nTwo small issues with how polyfill.io works If you browse through the list on their website, you\\u0026rsquo;ll notice many of the features have a star (★) next to them. These are the methods and APIs that are supported by default, and automatically sent to browsers that don\\u0026rsquo;t support them natively.\\nIt\\u0026rsquo;s a great list of commonly used and lightweight features, but probably includes a bunch of stuff you don\\u0026rsquo;t need on a project.\\nPolyfill.io also needs two round trips to the server to get your polyfills. On the first pass, it detects the visitor\\u0026rsquo;s browser, then sends that info back to the server, which generates and sends along the correct set of polyfills (the second trip).\\nDetecting features and skipping a trip Polyfill.io has an API that let\\u0026rsquo;s you control how it works with a few query string values.\\nYou can use the API to skip the first round trip and serve up a smaller file.\\nTo do this, we\\u0026rsquo;ll use feature tests to check for support for just the polyfills you need, and tell polyfill.io to send along just those. Here\\u0026rsquo;s how it works\\u0026hellip;\\n1. Create a list of the features this browser needs First, we\\u0026rsquo;ll set up an array, features, to hold the list of features we need polyfills for. Then, we\\u0026rsquo;ll create a few quick browser tests to check if those features are supported.\\nFor example, let\\u0026rsquo;s check for the CustomEvent API, Array.forEach(), matches(), and classList().\\n/** * Create a list of the features this browser needs */ // Setup our features array var features = []; // CustomEvent API if (typeof window.CustomEvent !== \\u0026#39;function\\u0026#39;) { features.push(\\u0026#39;CustomEvent\\u0026#39;); } // Array.forEach() if (window.Array \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; !Array.prototype.forEach) { features.push(\\u0026#39;Array.prototype.forEach\\u0026#39;); } // Element.matches() if (!Element.prototype.matches) { features.push(\\u0026#39;Element.prototype.matches\\u0026#39;); } // Element.classList() if (!(\\u0026#39;classList\\u0026#39; in document.createElement(\\u0026#39;_\\u0026#39;))) { features.push(\\u0026#39;Element.prototype.classList\\u0026#39;); }  With each check, if the feature is not supported natively, we use push() to add that feature to our features array.\\nHow do you know what the feature name is? Polyfill.io has a long feature list.\\n2. Add the loadJS() helper method. Yesterday, I mentioned loadJS, a super useful helper method from the Filament Group to lets you asynchronously load a JS file and run a callback once it\\u0026rsquo;s ready.\\nWe\\u0026rsquo;ll use that to load polyfill.io and our scripts.\\n/** * loadJS by Filament Group * Async load JS files * https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadJS/ */ var loadJS = function (src, cb) { // ... };  3. Load polyfill.io and our scripts Finally, we\\u0026rsquo;ll load polyfill.io and our scripts.\\nWe\\u0026rsquo;ll check the length of the features array to see if any features need to be polyfilled. If it has at least one item, we\\u0026rsquo;ll call polyfill.io. Otherwise, we\\u0026rsquo;ll immediately load our main scripts file.\\n// If any features need a polyfill, load Polyfill.io, then our scripts // Otherwise, just load our scripts if (features.length \\u0026gt; 0) { // load polyfill.io } else { // No polyfills needed, so just load the main.js file }  We\\u0026rsquo;ll use a few query string values with polyfill.io.\\nFirst, we\\u0026rsquo;ll set features to our features list, separated with a comma. We\\u0026rsquo;ll use the join() method to turn our array into a string.\\n\\u0026#39;https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.min.js?features=\\u0026#39; + features.join(\\u0026#39;,\\u0026#39;);  Next, we\\u0026rsquo;ll add what polyfill.io calls flags: always and gated.\\nThe always flag tells polyfill.io to include the requested features whether polyfill.io thinks your browser needs them or not (more on why we need that in a second). The gated flag tells the polyfills to include their own feature test before executing, in case our simple feature tests got it wrong.\\n\\u0026#39;https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.min.js?features=\\u0026#39; + features.join(\\u0026#39;,\\u0026#39;) + \\u0026#39;\\u0026amp;flags=gated,always\\u0026#39;;  Finally, we\\u0026rsquo;ll include a valid user agent value. This tells polyfill.io not to run its own UA check, and is why we need to use the always feature. Otherwise, polyfill.io would just send along polyfills for whatever browser UA you specified.\\n\\u0026#39;https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.min.js?features=\\u0026#39; + features.join(\\u0026#39;,\\u0026#39;) + \\u0026#39;\\u0026amp;flags=gated,always\\u0026amp;ua=chrome/50\\u0026#39;  Now we can call polyfill.io, and once it\\u0026rsquo;s loaded, run loadJS() again with our main scripts file.\\n/** * Load polyfill.io and scripts */ // If any features need a polyfill, load Polyfill.io, then our scripts // Otherwise, just load our scripts if (features.length \\u0026gt; 0) { // Include a `ua` argument set to a supported browser to skip UA identification \\t// (improves response time) and avoid being treated as unknown UA (which would \\t// otherwise result in no polyfills, even with `always`, if UA is unknown) \\tloadJS(\\u0026#39;https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.min.js?features=\\u0026#39; + features.join(\\u0026#39;,\\u0026#39;) + \\u0026#39;\\u0026amp;flags=gated,always\\u0026amp;ua=chrome/50\\u0026#39;, function () { // Once polyfill.io is loaded, load our main scripts \\tloadJS(\\u0026#39;/path/to/main.js\\u0026#39;); }); } else { // No polyfills needed, so just load the main.js file }  Finally, if polyfill.io isn\\u0026rsquo;t needed, we can immediately load our main scripts with loadJS().\\n/** * Load polyfill.io and scripts */ // If any features need a polyfill, load Polyfill.io, then our scripts // Otherwise, just load our scripts if (features.length \\u0026gt; 0) { // Include a `ua` argument set to a supported browser to skip UA identification \\t// (improves response time) and avoid being treated as unknown UA (which would \\t// otherwise result in no polyfills, even with `always`, if UA is unknown) \\tloadJS(\\u0026#39;https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.min.js?features=\\u0026#39; + features.join(\\u0026#39;,\\u0026#39;) + \\u0026#39;\\u0026amp;flags=gated,always\\u0026amp;ua=chrome/50\\u0026#39;, function () { // Once polyfill.io is loaded, load our main scripts \\tloadJS(\\u0026#39;/path/to/main.js\\u0026#39;); }); } else { // No polyfills needed, so just load the main.js file \\tloadJS(\\u0026#39;/path/to/main.js\\u0026#39;); }  Putting it all together Here\\u0026rsquo;s the full JavaScript to make this work.\\n/** * Create a list of the features this browser needs */ // Setup our features array var features = []; // CustomEvent API if (typeof window.CustomEvent !== \\u0026#39;function\\u0026#39;) { features.push(\\u0026#39;CustomEvent\\u0026#39;); } // Array.forEach() if (window.Array \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; !Array.prototype.forEach) { features.push(\\u0026#39;Array.prototype.forEach\\u0026#39;); } // Element.matches() if (!Element.prototype.matches) { features.push(\\u0026#39;Element.prototype.matches\\u0026#39;); } // Element.classList() if (!(\\u0026#39;classList\\u0026#39; in document.createElement(\\u0026#39;_\\u0026#39;))) { features.push(\\u0026#39;Element.prototype.classList\\u0026#39;); } /** * loadJS by Filament Group * Async load JS files * https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadJS/ */ var loadJS = function (src, cb) { // ... }; /** * Load polyfill.io and scripts */ // If any features need a polyfill, load Polyfill.io, then our scripts // Otherwise, just load our scripts if (features.length \\u0026gt; 0) { // Include a `ua` argument set to a supported browser to skip UA identification \\t// (improves response time) and avoid being treated as unknown UA (which would \\t// otherwise result in no polyfills, even with `always`, if UA is unknown) \\tloadJS(\\u0026#39;https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.min.js?features=\\u0026#39; + features.join(\\u0026#39;,\\u0026#39;) + \\u0026#39;\\u0026amp;flags=gated,always\\u0026amp;ua=chrome/50\\u0026#39;, function () { // Once polyfill.io is loaded, load our main scripts \\tloadJS(\\u0026#39;/path/to/main.js\\u0026#39;); }); } else { // No polyfills needed, so just load the main.js file \\tloadJS(\\u0026#39;/path/to/main.js\\u0026#39;); }  Downsides to this approach This approach has some nice advantages, but it has some disadvantages, too.\\nOnce of my favorite things about polyfill.io is the set-it-and-forget aspect of it. I don\\u0026rsquo;t have to think about what polyfills I need. Polyfill.io just takes care of it.\\nWith this approach, you need to very consciously choose what polyfills to check for and load. You also need to know how to write your own polyfill tests, where as the by default polyfill.io just kind of handles that piece for you.\\nI personally think the slight performance hit from the second round trip, and slightly bigger file (for all but the oldest browsers it\\u0026rsquo;s generally 5kb or less minified and gzipped) is a worthwhile tradeoff for effortless polyfilling. From a performance standpoint, that\\u0026rsquo;s an inconsequential file size, and its way smaller than most popular libraries and frameworks.\\nIn other words, I use the default implementation, but you may prefer not to.\\n\",\"summary\":\"Yesterday, I showed you how to use polyfill.io to conditionally load polyfills only for the browsers that need them.\\nWhat JavaScript methods and browser APIs does polyfill.io support?

I note, for example, that the classList polyfill is quite a chunk of code that could be shaved off when not needed.\\n So\\u0026hellip; should you conditionally load polyfills? And if so, how would you?\\nPolyfills conditionally run Most polyfills (the well written ones, anyways) include an if statement to check for native support before running.\\nFor example, this Array.forEach() polyfill checks to see if that feature exists, and only adds support if it\\u0026rsquo;s not already there.\\nif (window.Array \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; !Array.prototype.forEach) { Array.prototype.forEach = function (callback, thisArg) { thisArg = thisArg || window; for (var i = 0; i \\u0026lt; this.length; i++) { callback.call(thisArg, this[i], i, this); } }; }  However, the file still has to load to run this check, and depending on how many modern features you\\u0026rsquo;re using and how far back you want to push support, you may have a lot of them.\\nHow to conditionally load polyfills If you were going to conditionally load polyfills, you could use a helper function like Filament Group\\u0026rsquo;s loadJS().\\nYou would check for support, and if it doesn\\u0026rsquo;t exist, load the polyfill.\\nif (window.Array \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; !Array.prototype.forEach) { loadJS(\\u0026#39;/path/to/polyfills/array.foreach.js\\u0026#39;); }  There\\u0026rsquo;s a problem with this approach, though.\\nPolyfills loaded this way are loaded asynchronously, and there may be a bunch of them. With asynchronous scripts, we have no control over when they load, and you don\\u0026rsquo;t want to load and run your main JavaScript before the polyfills are available.\\nSo\\u0026hellip; what can you do instead? I use a combination of approaches, depending on the project.\\n1. Pick your baseline for JavaScript support I\\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of Brad Frost\\u0026rsquo;s \\u0026ldquo;support is not the same as optimization\\u0026rdquo; mantra. I support all browsers, but optimize for IE9 and up.\\nI only polyfill features that don\\u0026rsquo;t work back to IE9. For example, that means querySelector() and addEventListener() don\\u0026rsquo;t get polyfills, but classList does.\\n2. Include your polyfills with your main script With this approach, I usually need around 5kb or less of polyfills (minified). Compared to loading a big library or framework, this feels insignificant.\\nI include my polyfills as part of my main script so they all come over as one package.\\n3. Feature test before loading your script I use a simple feature test\\u0026mdash;an approach the BBC popularized called \\u0026ldquo;cutting the mustard\\u0026mdash;before even downloading my JavaScript file.\\nI use the loadJS() helper method I mentioned earlier to load the file if the visitor\\u0026rsquo;s browser passes the test.\\nif (\\u0026#39;querySelector\\u0026#39; in document \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; \\u0026#39;addEventListener\\u0026#39; in window) { loadJS(\\u0026#39;/path/to/my/main.js\\u0026#39;); }  With this approach, people who\\u0026rsquo;s browsers don\\u0026rsquo;t meet my minimum level for optimization don\\u0026rsquo;t download a file they can\\u0026rsquo;t use.\\nAnother approach: using a polyfill service I\\u0026rsquo;ve been using this approach for about 3 years, and it\\u0026rsquo;s worked really well.\\nBut\\u0026hellip; recently I\\u0026rsquo;ve been using a new approach that I like even better: a polyfill service.\\nPolyfill.io is a free service created by Jonathan Neal and the Financial Times (who are amazing contributors to the open source community, btw). It automatically detects which browser your visitor is using, and sends along a bundle of polyfills optimized for their browser.\\nTo use it, you just load it in a script tag.\\n\\u0026lt;script src=\\u0026#34;https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.min.js\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/script\\u0026gt; It adds support for some of the most popular ES5 and ES6 features all the way back to IE7. IE7!\\nThe latest version of Chrome gets no polyfills. Newer versions of Firefox and Safari get just 1kb or 2kb of polyfills. IE7 get\\u0026rsquo;s 15kb.\\nThink about that: you can use the latest ES6 methods, natively, and still support IE7.\\nNo bloated library. No precompilers or processors or command line tasks. It\\u0026rsquo;s awesome!\\nThese days, polyfill.io is my preferred way to polyfill.\\n\",\"summary\":\"If you\\u0026rsquo;ve ben reading my articles for a while, you already know that I\\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of polyfills (snippets of code that add support for a feature to browsers that don’t offer it natively).\\nLast week in my private Vanilla JS Slack channel (included with my pocket guides), one of my students asked how I handle loading polyfills.\\n Do you conditionally load polyfills?

Which one you chose is almost entirely a matter of personal taste. I think the more important thing is to pick one style of writing functions and stick with it throughout your script.\\nIf you need to call a function before it\\u0026rsquo;s declared, then, of course, use function declarations.\\nI personally prefer function expressions, and use them extensively in all of my code. I like them for one reason: they force more structure into the code base.\\nWith function expressions, I cannot call a function before I\\u0026rsquo;ve expressed it, so my code has a nice, neat structure to it. Functions that call other functions are written in a specific order every time, because they won\\u0026rsquo;t work otherwise.

I think the whole front end development process has gotten far too complicated.\\nOne chapter I started to write for my latest pocket guide, Web Apps with Vanilla JS, but decided not to include, is on when you actually should use a JS framework.\\nSpecifically, there are three situations where I think choosing a framework makes more sense than using vanilla JavaScript.\\n1. Large apps that need to scale. One of the biggest benefits of frameworks like React and VueJS is that they provide a virtual DOM.\\nWhat\\u0026rsquo;s a virtual DOM?\\nThe DOM, or Document Object Model, is the nested tree of elements on a webpage. Manipulating it is (relatively speaking) a bit slow compared to working in JavaScript.\\nA virtual DOM is a JavaScript-based map of the actual DOM using nested objects. For example, this:\\n\\u0026lt;div class=\\u0026#34;sandwich\\u0026#34; id=\\u0026#34;tuna\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;div class=\\u0026#34;topping\\u0026#34; id=\\u0026#34;lettuce\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;Yum!\\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt; Might become something like this:\\n{ div: { class: \\u0026#39;sandwich\\u0026#39;, id: \\u0026#39;tuna\\u0026#39;, elements: { div: { class: \\u0026#39;topping\\u0026#39;, id: \\u0026#39;lettuce\\u0026#39;, innerHTML: \\u0026#39;Yum!\\u0026#39; } } } }  When you make an update to that content, instead of rendering the entire .sandwich element again, a \\u0026ldquo;diffing\\u0026rdquo; algorithm would create a virtual DOM map of the new content, compare it to the old one, and then only update the things that changed.\\nThat could mean just updating a class, or just the innerHTML on an element within a bigger component.\\nDoes that mean vanilla JavaScript isn\\u0026rsquo;t performant? Not at all.\\nIf you\\u0026rsquo;ve been reading my articles for a while, you\\u0026rsquo;ve hopefully already seen how fast vanilla JS can be. In fact, the abstraction of frameworks can make your code slower than vanilla JavaScript.\\nHowever, on larger apps that are handling huge amounts of data (think Facebook, Twitter, and so on), the virtual DOM likely provides some real performance gains.\\nIf you\\u0026rsquo;re working at that kind of scale, you might want to consider using a framework.\\n2. Server-side rendering for better fault-tolerance. React and Vue both provide plugins that let you run your JavaScript on the server.\\nThis means that:\\n You can still serve your app to people who don\\u0026rsquo;t support modern JS or for whom the JavaScript file failed. You benefit from the faster time-to-first-render that server-side HTML provides, but can still take advantage of faster subsequent page rendering via Ajax.  You can do server-side rendering with vanilla JS, but it\\u0026rsquo;s gets really complicated, and frameworks provide an abstraction that\\u0026rsquo;s insanely beneficial.\\n3. Working with large teams. This one is kind of\\u0026hellip; meh, but I see it come up a fair bit.\\nIf you\\u0026rsquo;re working with a large team, or external developers, using a well-known, well-established framework with existing documentation can make time-to-learn shorter and make finding people who can work on your app easier.\\nThe flip-side of this is that frameworks can update frequently in significant, breaking ways that make upgrading harder (Angular 1 to Angular 2 is an example). Documentation may not be clear or obvious. Or it can change without notice.\\nAnd as anyone who\\u0026rsquo;s been doing this for a few years knows, projects can stop being supported or fall out of favor pretty quickly.\\nThat said, if you don\\u0026rsquo;t have time to write good documentation for a larger team, or need to pull from a broader pool of developers, a framework might be worth considering.\\n\",\"summary\":\"I spend a lot of time teaching people how to write JavaScript without frameworks.

This let\\u0026rsquo;s me search for content inside it with querySelector().\\nThe response type property is only supported in IE10 and up, so I do a quick feature check before running it.\\n// Set up our HTTP request var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); if (!(\\u0026#39;responseType\\u0026#39; in xhr)) return;  On success, I can grab my #pricing-parity-content message with querySelector() and grab it\\u0026rsquo;s contents with innerHTML.\\n// Get the content and render it var pricing = xhr.response.querySelector(\\u0026#39;#pricing-parity-content\\u0026#39;); if (!pricing) return; renderPricingParity(pricing.innerHTML);  sessionStorage I also save my message to sessionStorage so that I only have to make the Ajax call once. After that, I can just pull the discount text directly from storage.\\n// Save the content to sessionStorage sessionStorage.setItem(\\u0026#39;gmt-pricing-parity\\u0026#39;, pricing.innerHTML);  When the script first loads, I check to see if there\\u0026rsquo;s an entry in sessionStorage, and if so, immediately run my renderPricingParity() method.\\n// Get and render pricing parity info var pricing = sessionStorage.getItem(\\u0026#39;gmt-pricing-parity\\u0026#39;); if (typeof pricing === \\u0026#39;string\\u0026#39;) { renderPricingParity(pricing); } else { getPricingParity(); }  You\\u0026rsquo;ll notice I\\u0026rsquo;m checking if it\\u0026rsquo;s a string, and not whether or not it exists. If there was no discount, its saved as an empty string, and if (pricing) {} would fail, triggering another, unnecessary Ajax call.\\nCreating a new element I use document.createElement to create a new div, and insertBefore() to inject it into the DOM. I add a handful of properties specific to my layout to give it some style.\\n// Create container var pricing = document.createElement(\\u0026#39;div\\u0026#39;); pricing.id = \\u0026#39;pricing-parity\\u0026#39;; pricing.className = \\u0026#39;bg-muted padding-top-small padding-bottom-small\\u0026#39;; pricing.innerHTML = data; // Insert into the DOM nav.parentNode.insertBefore(pricing, nav);  Only running it on sales pages Before rendering anything, I run a quick check to make sure the page is a product or checkout page.\\nI\\u0026rsquo;m using a simple regex pattern to check for /guides/ or /checkout/ in the URL pathname.

Today, let\\u0026rsquo;s look at the vanilla JS version of off(), which removes an event listener.\\nThe completely native way With vanilla JavaScript, you can remove any named event listener with removeEventListener(). It accepts all of the same arguments as addEventListener(), and those arguments must match the ones you used to add the event.\\nSo, for example, if you added this click event:\\nvar clickHandler = function (event) { // Prevent the link from updating the URL  event.preventDefault(); // Do something...  }; var link = document.querySelector(\\u0026#39;#some-link\\u0026#39;); link.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;click\\u0026#39;, clickHandler, false);  You can remove it like this:\\nlink.removeEventListener(\\u0026#39;click\\u0026#39;, clickHandler, false);  The off() method First, I’ll show you how to use it. Then, I’ll share the method itself.

The second argument is an optional filter, if you\\u0026rsquo;re removing events on a certain selector.\\nYou can omit it and jump straight to argument three, the callback. This is the function that runs on the event, and for this to work, it must be named. The final optional argument is use capture.\\nAll of the arguments must match the ones you used in on(). So, if you did this:\\n// Listen to all clicks on links with the .click-me class on(\\u0026#39;click\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;.click-me\\u0026#39;, function clickHandler (event) { // Prevent the link from working  event.preventDefault(); });  You\\u0026rsquo;d remove it like this:\\noff(\\u0026#39;click\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;.click-me\\u0026#39;, clickHandler);  If you used event bubbling like this:\\n// Listen to all click events on(\\u0026#39;click\\u0026#39;, function allClicks (event) { // The thing that was clicked  var clicked = event.target; });  You\\u0026rsquo;d remove it like this:\\noff(\\u0026#39;click\\u0026#39;, allClicks);  The Helper Method /*! * Remove an event listener * (c) 2017 Chris Ferdinandi, MIT License, https://gomakethings.com * @param {String} event The event type * @param {Node} elem The element to remove the event to (optional, defaults to window) * @param {Function} callback The callback that ran on the event * @param {Boolean} capture If true, forces bubbling on non-bubbling events */ var off = function (event, elem, callback, capture) { if (typeof (elem) === \\u0026#39;function\\u0026#39;) { capture = callback; callback = elem; elem = window; } capture = capture ? true : false; elem = typeof elem === \\u0026#39;string\\u0026#39; ? document.querySelector(elem) : elem; if (!elem) return; elem.removeEventListener(event, callback, capture); };  How it works We\\u0026rsquo;re essentially doing the same thing we did in our on() method, and then calling removeEventListener() instead.\\nFirst, we check to see if the second argument is an element selector or a callback function.

The approach is fast and simple, but falls apart pretty quickly for all but the most basic of arrays.\\nToday, we\\u0026rsquo;re going to look at a much more robust way to compare two arrays (or objects) and check if they\\u0026rsquo;re equal to each other.\\nWhat we need to compare You could have a simple array, like this one.\\nvar arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];  Or, you could have a complex, multidimensional array with various types of inputs.\\nvar arr = [1, \\u0026#39;something\\u0026#39;, 3, { item1: 42, item2: \\u0026#39;another thing\\u0026#39;, item3: function () { console.log(\\u0026#39;running!\\u0026#39;); } }, 5];  To properly compare two arrays or objects, we need to check:\\n That they\\u0026rsquo;re the same object type (array vs. object). That they have the same number of items. That each item is equal to its counterpart in the other array or object.  That they\\u0026rsquo;re the same object type (array vs. object vs. string vs. number vs. function). That they have the same value.   And if the item is itself an array or object, we need to compare all of its values against that same items values in the other array or object.\\nTo make this all work, we\\u0026rsquo;re going to create a helper function to test all of these things. Let\\u0026rsquo;s get started\\u0026hellip;\\nSetting up our helper function Let\\u0026rsquo;s create a helper function called isEqual() (the same name used by libraries like Underscores and lodash, for the sake of keeping with convention).\\nWe\\u0026rsquo;ll accept two arguments: the value is one array or object, and other is the other array or object to compare it against.\\nvar isEqual = function (value, other) { // Code will go here... };  We\\u0026rsquo;re going to run a series of tests in our helper function. If at any point one of them fails, we\\u0026rsquo;ll immediately return false to indicate they\\u0026rsquo;re not equal.\\nIf at the end the function is still running, it means all of our tests and comparisons passed and we can return true. They\\u0026rsquo;re a match.\\nvar isEqual = function (value, other) { // Tests will go here...  // If nothing failed, return true \\treturn true; };  Some basic tests There are a few basic tests we can run right away to quickly eliminate any arrays or objects that obviously aren\\u0026rsquo;t equal.\\nFirst, if value is an object and other is an array (or vice-versa), they\\u0026rsquo;re not equal. We\\u0026rsquo;ll use Object.prototype.toString.call() to get the true object type (typeof returns object for both objects and arrays) and compare them. We\\u0026rsquo;re going to need the object type later in our function, so for value, we\\u0026rsquo;ll save it to a variable.\\nvar isEqual = function (value, other) { // Get the value type \\tvar type = Object.prototype.toString.call(value); // If the two objects are not the same type, return false \\tif (type !== Object.prototype.toString.call(other)) return false; // More tests will go here...  // If nothing failed, return true \\treturn true; };  Next, we want to make sure our two items are either an object or an array. Our function won\\u0026rsquo;t really be setup to compare strings, functions, and so on.\\nWe\\u0026rsquo;ll use Arry.typeOf() against our type variable for this.\\nvar isEqual = function (value, other) { // Get the value type \\tvar type = Object.prototype.toString.call(value); // If the two objects are not the same type, return false \\tif (type !== Object.prototype.toString.call(other)) return false; // If items are not an object or array, return false \\tif ([\\u0026#39;[object Array]\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;[object Object]\\u0026#39;].indexOf(type) \\u0026lt; 0) return false; // More tests will go here...  // If nothing failed, return true \\treturn true; };  Finally, if our two arrays or objects have a different number of items in them, they\\u0026rsquo;re not equal.\\nYou can easily get the value of an array using array.length. For objects, we can use Object.keys() to get an array of the object\\u0026rsquo;s keys, and then get the length of that.\\nObject.keys() works in all modern browsers, and IE9 and up, but there\\u0026rsquo;s a polyfill if you need more backwards compatibility. We\\u0026rsquo;ll create variables for the length of both value and other, and use a ternary operator to set it based on our type. Then, we\\u0026rsquo;ll compare our two lengths. If they\\u0026rsquo;re not equal, we\\u0026rsquo;ll return false.\\nvar isEqual = function (value, other) { // Get the value type \\tvar type = Object.prototype.toString.call(value); // If the two objects are not the same type, return false \\tif (type !== Object.prototype.toString.call(other)) return false; // If items are not an object or array, return false \\tif ([\\u0026#39;[object Array]\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;[object Object]\\u0026#39;].indexOf(type) \\u0026lt; 0) return false; // Compare the length of the length of the two items \\tvar valueLen = type === \\u0026#39;[object Array]\\u0026#39; ? value.length : Object.keys(value).length; var otherLen = type === \\u0026#39;[object Array]\\u0026#39; ? other.length : Object.keys(other).length; if (valueLen !== otherLen) return false; // More tests will go here...  // If nothing failed, return true \\treturn true; };  Comparing item values Now that we\\u0026rsquo;ve got some basic checks out of the way, we can start comparing the values of the items in our array or object.\\nTo start, we want to loop through each item in our value array or object. The way you look through objects and arrays, is different, so let\\u0026rsquo;s setup an if...else statement to check out type, and create the appropriate loop.\\nvar isEqual = function (value, other) { // Get the value type \\tvar type = Object.prototype.toString.call(value); // If the two objects are not the same type, return false \\tif (type !== Object.prototype.toString.call(other)) return false; // If items are not an object or array, return false \\tif ([\\u0026#39;[object Array]\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;[object Object]\\u0026#39;].indexOf(type) \\u0026lt; 0) return false; // Compare the length of the length of the two items \\tvar valueLen = type === \\u0026#39;[object Array]\\u0026#39; ? value.length : Object.keys(value).length; var otherLen = type === \\u0026#39;[object Array]\\u0026#39; ? other.length : Object.keys(other).length; if (valueLen !== otherLen) return false; // Compare properties \\tif (type === \\u0026#39;[object Array]\\u0026#39;) { for (var i = 0; i \\u0026lt; valueLen; i++) { // Compare the item \\t} } else { for (var key in value) { if (value.hasOwnProperty(key)) { // Compare the item \\t} } } // If nothing failed, return true \\treturn true; };  We\\u0026rsquo;re going to compare the items the same way whether it\\u0026rsquo;s an object or an array, and we don\\u0026rsquo;t want to write the same code twice. Let\\u0026rsquo;s set up a compare() function that we can pass our value and other items into.\\nWe\\u0026rsquo;ll pass in either the value[i] or value[key] as the first argument, and other[i] or other[key]\\u0026mdash;the comparable item in the other object or array\\u0026mdash; as the second argument.\\nvar isEqual = function (value, other) { // Get the value type \\tvar type = Object.prototype.toString.call(value); // If the two objects are not the same type, return false \\tif (type !== Object.prototype.toString.call(other)) return false; // If items are not an object or array, return false \\tif ([\\u0026#39;[object Array]\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;[object Object]\\u0026#39;].indexOf(type) \\u0026lt; 0) return false; // Compare the length of the length of the two items \\tvar valueLen = type === \\u0026#39;[object Array]\\u0026#39; ? value.length : Object.keys(value).length; var otherLen = type === \\u0026#39;[object Array]\\u0026#39; ? other.length : Object.keys(other).length; if (valueLen !== otherLen) return false; // Compare two items \\tvar compare = function (item1, item2) { // Code will go here... \\t}; // Compare properties \\tvar match; if (type === \\u0026#39;[object Array]\\u0026#39;) { for (var i = 0; i \\u0026lt; valueLen; i++) { compare(value[i], other[i]); } } else { for (var key in value) { if (value.hasOwnProperty(key)) { compare(value[key], other[key]); } } } // If nothing failed, return true \\treturn true; };  Comparing two items First, let\\u0026rsquo;s get the type for our item. We\\u0026rsquo;ll need this information more than once, so let\\u0026rsquo;s set it to the itemType variable.\\nIf it\\u0026rsquo;s an array or object, we\\u0026rsquo;ll pass it back into the isEqual() method. When a function calls itself like this, it\\u0026rsquo;s known as a rescursive function. If the test fails, we\\u0026rsquo;ll return false.\\n// Compare two items var compare = function (item1, item2) { // Get the object type \\tvar itemType = Object.prototype.toString.call(item1); // If an object or array, compare recursively \\tif ([\\u0026#39;[object Array]\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;[object Object]\\u0026#39;].indexOf(itemType) \\u0026gt;= 0) { if (!isEqual(item1, item2)) return false; } };  If it\\u0026rsquo;s not an array or object, we\\u0026rsquo;ll do a simple comparison to check our two item values. First, we\\u0026rsquo;ll make sure that item1 and item2 are the same type.\\n// Compare two items var compare = function (item1, item2) { // Get the object type \\tvar itemType = Object.prototype.toString.call(item1); // If an object or array, compare recursively \\tif ([\\u0026#39;[object Array]\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;[object Object]\\u0026#39;].indexOf(itemType) \\u0026gt;= 0) { if (!isEqual(item1, item2)) return false; } // Otherwise, do a simple comparison \\telse { // If the two items are not the same type, return false \\tif (itemType !== Object.prototype.toString.call(item2)) return false; } };  Now, we can compare are two values using a simple === comparison operator.\\nWe need to account for one last edge case, though. If the item is a function, we need to convert it to a string using the toString() method so that we can compare it. Otherwise (if it\\u0026rsquo;s a string or number), we can just compare it as-is.\\n// Compare two items var compare = function (item1, item2) { // Get the object type \\tvar itemType = Object.prototype.toString.call(item1); // If an object or array, compare recursively \\tif ([\\u0026#39;[object Array]\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;[object Object]\\u0026#39;].indexOf(itemType) \\u0026gt;= 0) { if (!isEqual(item1, item2)) return false; } // Otherwise, do a simple comparison \\telse { // If the two items are not the same type, return false \\tif (itemType !== Object.prototype.toString.call(item2)) return false; // If it\\u0026#39;s a function, convert to a string and compare \\t// Otherwise, just compare \\tif (itemType === \\u0026#39;[object Function]\\u0026#39;) { if (item1.toString() !== item2.toString()) return false; } else { if (item1 !== item2) return false; } } };  Getting the value of our compare() function As we loop through each item and compare it, we need to check if our compare() function returns false. If it does, we need to return false, too, since the two items are not a match.\\n(The return false in compare() is scoped to that function and doesn\\u0026rsquo;t affect the isEqual() function.)\\nvar isEqual = function (value, other) { // ...  // Compare properties \\tif (type === \\u0026#39;[object Array]\\u0026#39;) { for (var i = 0; i \\u0026lt; valueLen; i++) { if (compare(value[i], other[i]) === false) return false; } } else { for (var key in value) { if (value.hasOwnProperty(key)) { if (compare(value[key], other[key]) === false) return false; } } } // If nothing failed, return true \\treturn true; };  Putting it all together We can now test two objects or arrays to see if they\\u0026rsquo;re equal by passing them in to our isEqual() function.\\nvar arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; var arr2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; isEqual(arr1, arr2); // returns true  var arrObj1 = [1, 2, { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }, 4, 5]; var arrObj2 = [1, 2, { c: 3, b: 2, a: 1 }, 4, 5]; isEqual(arrObj1, arrObj2); // returns true  var arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; var arr3 = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]; isEqual(arr1, arr3); // returns false  Here\\u0026rsquo;s the complete helper function.\\nvar isEqual = function (value, other) { // Get the value type \\tvar type = Object.prototype.toString.call(value); // If the two objects are not the same type, return false \\tif (type !== Object.prototype.toString.call(other)) return false; // If items are not an object or array, return false \\tif ([\\u0026#39;[object Array]\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;[object Object]\\u0026#39;].indexOf(type) \\u0026lt; 0) return false; // Compare the length of the length of the two items \\tvar valueLen = type === \\u0026#39;[object Array]\\u0026#39; ? value.length : Object.keys(value).length; var otherLen = type === \\u0026#39;[object Array]\\u0026#39; ? other.length : Object.keys(other).length; if (valueLen !== otherLen) return false; // Compare two items \\tvar compare = function (item1, item2) { // Get the object type \\tvar itemType = Object.prototype.toString.call(item1); // If an object or array, compare recursively \\tif ([\\u0026#39;[object Array]\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;[object Object]\\u0026#39;].indexOf(itemType) \\u0026gt;= 0) { if (!isEqual(item1, item2)) return false; } // Otherwise, do a simple comparison \\telse { // If the two items are not the same type, return false \\tif (itemType !== Object.prototype.toString.call(item2)) return false; // Else if it\\u0026#39;s a function, convert to a string and compare \\t// Otherwise, just compare \\tif (itemType === \\u0026#39;[object Function]\\u0026#39;) { if (item1.toString() !== item2.toString()) return false; } else { if (item1 !== item2) return false; } } }; // Compare properties \\tif (type === \\u0026#39;[object Array]\\u0026#39;) { for (var i = 0; i \\u0026lt; valueLen; i++) { if (compare(value[i], other[i]) === false) return false; } } else { for (var key in value) { if (value.hasOwnProperty(key)) { if (compare(value[key], other[key]) === false) return false; } } } // If nothing failed, return true \\treturn true; }; \",\"summary\":\"Yesterday, we looked at a way to tell if two arrays are equal with JavaScript.

Today, let\\u0026rsquo;s look at the simplest approach.\\nCompare as strings The simplest and fastest way to compare two arrays is to convert them both to strings using the JSON.stringify() method and a comparison operator (===).\\nvar arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; var arr2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; if (JSON.stringify(arr1) === JSON.stringify(arr2)) { console.log(\\u0026#39;They are equal!\\u0026#39;); }  This approach is great for really basic instances when you just need to check if a simple array of items is equal to another.\\nIt can fall apart pretty quickly, though.\\nWhen it doesn\\u0026rsquo;t work Since you\\u0026rsquo;re comparing two strings, your arrays are only considered equal if they\\u0026rsquo;re in the same exact order. For example, these two arrays would not be equal using the JSON.stringify() method.\\nvar arr2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; var arr3 = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1];  They\\u0026rsquo;re the same exact length and contain the same exact values, but in a different order. Not equal.\\nMaybe that\\u0026rsquo;s ok. After all, arrays are are supposed to be sequentially ordered.\\nObject aren\\u0026rsquo;t, though. If your array contains an object as it\\u0026rsquo;s value, the order of the object keys might be different even if the two objects have all the same keys and values. It, too, would fail using the JSON.stringify() method.\\n// These would not be equal var arrObj1 = [1, 2, { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }, 4, 5]; var arrObj2 = [1, 2, { c: 3, b: 2, a: 1 }, 4, 5];  Tomorrow, I\\u0026rsquo;m going to show you a more complex, slightly slower, but much more robust method we can use to test if two arrays are equal.\\n\",\"summary\":\"Over the weekend, one of the students my in private Slack channel (included with my pocket guides) asked me what the best way to check if two arrays are equal is.\\nIf you Google this, you\\u0026rsquo;ll find a lot of different answers, and StackOverflow contains a lot of people arguing with each other over what the \\u0026ldquo;right\\u0026rdquo; way is.

We can modify that technique to detect when a file is loaded.\\nThis will only work if the script in question has a public method or namespace that you can hook into.\\nInstead of checking that document.body exists like we did yesterday, we\\u0026rsquo;ll look to see if the function name is available in the window.

YouTube and Vimeo both use autoplay=1 as a query string in the URL, while HTML5 videos have an autoplay property.\\nBut, if you include those parameters directly in the markup, the video will autoplay when the page loads, whether or not the modal is open.\\nWe need a modal plugin that has a callback or event that runs after a modal opens. We can hook into that and add our parameter or property when the modal opens, and remove it when it closes.\\nMy Modals plugin has callbacks that run when modals are opened or closed, and I\\u0026rsquo;m sure some other popular plugins do, too.\\nAdding the autoplay parameter Let\\u0026rsquo;s create a function called autoplayVideo(). We\\u0026rsquo;ll pass the modal we want to play the video in as an argument.\\nvar autoplayVideo = function (modal) { // Code goes here... };  The first thing we want to do is get our video. We\\u0026rsquo;ll use querySelector() to search inside the modal.\\nquerySelector() lets you pass in multiple selectors, separated by a comma, and will grab the first matching element. We\\u0026rsquo;ll looking for iframes with either YouTube or Vimeo in the src, as well as video elements.\\nIf the modal doesn\\u0026rsquo;t have a matching video, we\\u0026rsquo;ll call return to bail on the function.\\nvar autoplayVideo = function (modal) { // Look for a YouTube, Vimeo, or HTML5 video in the modal \\tvar video = modal.querySelector(\\u0026#39;iframe[src*=\\u0026#34;www.youtube.com\\u0026#34;], iframe[src*=\\u0026#34;player.vimeo.com\\u0026#34;], video\\u0026#39;); // Bail if the modal doesn\\u0026#39;t have a video \\tif (!video) return; };  Next, we want to check if the video is an HTML5 video element. HTML5 videos expose a JavaScript API. If it is, we can call video.play() to make the video start playing.\\nWe\\u0026rsquo;ll use tagName to get the type of element our video is, and toLowerCase() to convert it to lowercase, as some browsers return uppercase tag names and string comparisons are case-specific. It it\\u0026rsquo;s a match, we can return to end our function after playing the video.\\nvar autoplayVideo = function (modal) { // Look for a YouTube, Vimeo, or HTML5 video in the modal \\tvar video = modal.querySelector(\\u0026#39;iframe[src*=\\u0026#34;www.youtube.com\\u0026#34;], iframe[src*=\\u0026#34;player.vimeo.com\\u0026#34;], video\\u0026#39;); // Bail if the modal doesn\\u0026#39;t have a video \\tif (!video) return; // If an HTML5 video, play it \\tif (video.tagName.toLowerCase() === \\u0026#39;video\\u0026#39;) { video.play(); return; } };  Finally, if it\\u0026rsquo;s an iframe, we\\u0026rsquo;ll get the current src attribute and add autoplay=1 to it to cause it to start playing.\\nBecause the video src might already have other query parameters on it, we\\u0026rsquo;ll check to see if there\\u0026rsquo;s a ? in the URL already. If there is, we\\u0026rsquo;ll add an \\u0026amp; before our autoplay parameter. If not, we\\u0026rsquo;ll add a ?.\\nvar autoplayVideo = function (modal) { // Look for a YouTube, Vimeo, or HTML5 video in the modal \\tvar video = modal.querySelector(\\u0026#39;iframe[src*=\\u0026#34;www.youtube.com\\u0026#34;], iframe[src*=\\u0026#34;player.vimeo.com\\u0026#34;], video\\u0026#39;); // Bail if the modal doesn\\u0026#39;t have a video \\tif (!video) return; // If an HTML5 video, play it \\tif (video.tagName.toLowerCase() === \\u0026#39;video\\u0026#39;) { video.play(); return; } // Add autoplay to video src \\t// video.src: the current video `src` attribute \\t// (video.src.indexOf(\\u0026#39;?\\u0026#39;) \\u0026lt; 0 ? \\u0026#39;?\\u0026#39; : \\u0026#39;\\u0026amp;\\u0026#39;): if the video.src already has query string parameters, add an \\u0026#34;\\u0026amp;\\u0026#34;.

In my modals script, the callback is an option you can pass in at initialization.\\nIt exposes the button that toggled the modal and the modal itself as arguments.\\nmodals.init({ callbackOpen: function ( toggle, modal ) { autoplayVideo(modal); } });  Stopping the video when the modal closes If you\\u0026rsquo;re going to autoplay a video when the modal opens, you should also stop it when the modal closes.\\nTo accomplish this, we\\u0026rsquo;ll create a new stopVideo() function, and reverse what we did in autoplayVideo().\\nTo stop an HTML5 video, we\\u0026rsquo;ll use video.pause(). For iframes, we\\u0026rsquo;ll use the replace() method to remove ?autoplay=1 and \\u0026amp;autoplay=1 from the video source and then reset it. This reloads the video and stops it from playing.\\n/** * Stop a YouTube, Vimeo, or HTML5 video * @param {Node} modal The modal to search inside */ var stopVideo = function (modal) { // Look for a YouTube, Vimeo, or HTML5 video in the modal \\tvar video = modal.querySelector(\\u0026#39;iframe[src*=\\u0026#34;www.youtube.com\\u0026#34;], iframe[src*=\\u0026#34;player.vimeo.com\\u0026#34;], video\\u0026#39;); // Bail if the modal doesn\\u0026#39;t have a video \\tif (!video) return; // If an HTML5 video, pause it \\tif (video.tagName.toLowerCase() === \\u0026#39;video\\u0026#39;) { video.pause(); return; } // Remove autoplay from video src \\tvideo.src = video.src.replace(\\u0026#39;\\u0026amp;autoplay=1\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;).replace(\\u0026#39;?autoplay=1\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;); };  Don\\u0026rsquo;t forget to pass the stopVideo() function in to your callback as well.\\nmodals.init({ callbackOpen: function ( toggle, modal ) { autoplayVideo(modal); }, callbackClose: function ( toggle, modal ) { stopVideo(modal); } });  Here\\u0026rsquo;s a demo of all of this in action.\\n\",\"summary\":\"Over the weekend, Kabolobari, one of my students, asked me how to make videos autoplay after a modal is opened (shared with permission).\\n What\\u0026rsquo;s the best way (or best plugin) to do vanilla js modal window that also auto play video in it when it\\u0026rsquo;s triggered?\\n Today, let\\u0026rsquo;s look at how to do that.\\nPicking the right modal plugin YouTube, Vimeo, and HTML5 videos all have parameters that let you autoplay them.\",\"title\":\"How to autoplay videos after a modal opens\",\"url\":\"https://gomakethings.com/how-to-autoplay-videos-after-a-modal-opens/\"},{\"categories\":[\"Code\",\"JavaScript\"],\"content\":\" Over the weekend, reader Kumar asked me how to create a micro-library (a super tiny, personal jQuery) with chainable functions using vanilla JavaScript (shared with permission).\\nToday, let\\u0026rsquo;s look at how to do that.\\nSetting up your micro-library The first step is to setup your micro-library.\\nDepending on your user case, there a few different patterns you can use, but to keep things simple, we\\u0026rsquo;ll just create a basic function.\\nTo avoid conflicts with other libraries and frameworks that use the $ shorthand, we\\u0026rsquo;ll call ours m (for \\u0026ldquo;micro\\u0026rdquo;).\\nvar m = function () { // Codes will go here... };  Creating a selector function In Kumar\\u0026rsquo;s case, he wanted to be able to select elements in the DOM and then do things with them, so we\\u0026rsquo;ll need to create a selector function to handle that.\\nWe\\u0026rsquo;re going to use querySelectorAll() to get our elements.

This is going to help power our chaining functionality later.\\nvar m = function (selector) { // Get all elements that match our selector \\tvar Micro = function () { this.nodes = document.querySelectorAll(selector); }; };  You may not always want to search the whole document, though. querySelectorAll also let\\u0026rsquo;s you search inside a specific element. Let\\u0026rsquo;s provide a way to do that by adding an optional context argument.\\nvar m = function (selector, context) { // Get all elements that match our selector \\tvar Micro = function () { this.nodes = context ? context.querySelectorAll(selector) : document.querySelectorAll(selector); }; };  Setting up a new function In order to use this, we need to return our selector engine so it can be accessed with the m function.\\nvar m = function (selector, context) { // Get all elements that match our selector \\tvar Micro = function () { this.nodes = context ? context.querySelectorAll(selector) : document.querySelectorAll(selector); }; // Setup our new constructor \\treturn new Micro(); };  This creates a new instance of our selector engine with it\\u0026rsquo;s own unique nodes property.

This is much better for performance.\\nFor example, if we wanted to add a class to every node we selected, we could do this.\\nvar m = function (selector, context) { // Get all elements that match our selector \\tvar Micro = function () { this.nodes = context ? context.querySelectorAll(selector) : document.querySelectorAll(selector); }; // Add a class to our elements \\tMicro.prototype.addClass = function (className) { // Loop through each element and use classList to add our class \\tfor (var i = 0; i \\u0026lt; this.nodes.length; i++) { this.nodes[i].classList.add(className); } }; // Setup our new constructor \\treturn new Micro(); };  You\\u0026rsquo;ll notice that the function references this.nodes in the loop.

To use it, you just add this to your site:\\n\\u0026lt;script src=\\u0026#34;https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.min.js\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/script\\u0026gt; What it does The service automatically detects your visitor\\u0026rsquo;s browser and generates a set of polyfills that patch any holes in their browser\\u0026rsquo;s features. It works all the way back to IE7 for most features!\\nThe latest version of Chrome get\\u0026rsquo;s nothing. IE7 gets about 15kb of code. Most browsers get somewhere around 5kb. (These numbers are after gzipping.)\\nThink about that: with just 15kb of code, you can use some of the most modern and cutting edge JavaScript features, natively, in Internet Explorer 7.\\nNo big libraries or frameworks. No new syntaxes to learn. No pre-compilers or module bundlers (though you certainly can use those things if you like them). Just modern, vanilla JavaScript.\\nMy thoughts When I first wrote about Polyfill.io, I had not yet used it on a project, but heard a lot of great things about it from others.\\nI\\u0026rsquo;ve now had the chance to use it on a large project, and I\\u0026rsquo;m never looking back.\\nPolyfill.io pushed me head first into ES6, which I had previously been hesitant to use because of the lack of native browser support. Polyfill.io just makes it all so easy. My previous bar for entry was IE9. I can now provide even broader support with less work!\\nThis is a no-brainer for me. I\\u0026rsquo;m using it on every project.\\nWhat features are supported? Polyfill.io has a growing list of supported features.\\nFeatures with a star next to them are included by default. They\\u0026rsquo;re selected for their broad support, popularity, and performance impact. You can add additional features using flags.\\nPolyfill.io also recommends using an async loading technique. This is the strategy I would use for most projects, but for JavaScript-powered apps, I would load it with a traditional script tag, since you want your code to execute as quickly as possible.\\nI could go on and on about this project.

Code is still a great text editor. I still recommend it to all of my students.\\nBut\\u0026hellip; after installing a bunch of plugins, I found that Code would get a touch laggy with extended use. I\\u0026rsquo;d have to shut it down and reopen it to fix the problem. I let the Code team know, and I\\u0026rsquo;m certain they\\u0026rsquo;ll get it figured out, but Sublime never ran into issues like that for me.\\nSo, I switched back. But with a few changes.\\nCode has a bunch of really nice features that I missed in Sublime. I upgraded from Sublime 2 to Sublime 3, and went looking for plugins to pull my favorite features from Code into Sublime.\\nHere\\u0026rsquo;s my setup\\u0026hellip;\\nPackage Manageament Oddly, Sublime Text does not include a package manager by default like Code does.\\nThe first thing anyone should install is Package Control. It lacks the nice visual preview that the package manager in Code does, but it\\u0026rsquo;s still quite useful.\\nIn version 3, Sublime made a change to the way packages are stored. The package resource viewer plugin helps you find packages that are otherwise hidden deep in the file system.\\nThemes As I mentioned in my post on Visual Studio Code, I\\u0026rsquo;m all-in on Monokai.\\nI use the Monokai Extended theme, which offers traditional Monokai as well as a light version. I use the original at night, and the light version during the day (since I work outside a lot).\\nI actually use a slightly tweaked version of Monokai Light that\\u0026rsquo;s more like the one for Code. You can find it on GitHub.\\nCode makes it really easy to switch themes with a keyboard shortcut. To get this functionality in Sublime, I added the Schemr plugin. Then I added Monokai and Monokai Light to my favorites. Finally, under my keybindings, I added the option to toggle between my favorites by clicking command+k+t.\\n[ { \\u0026#34;keys\\u0026#34;: [\\u0026#34;super+k\\u0026#34;, \\u0026#34;super+t\\u0026#34;], \\u0026#34;command\\u0026#34;: \\u0026#34;schemr_cycle_favorite_schemes\\u0026#34;, \\u0026#34;args\\u0026#34;: {\\u0026#34;direction\\u0026#34;: \\u0026#34;next\\u0026#34;}} ]  Working with JavaScript There\\u0026rsquo;s not really a ton that\\u0026rsquo;s needed here.\\nThe JavaScript Completions plugin adds better autocomplete for JS. I also use SublimeLinter with JSHint to live lint my code.\\nYou can configure JSHint, but I just roll with the defaults. It lints your code as you write it, giving nice visual clues when you\\u0026rsquo;ve messed something up.\\nWorking with CSS The Sass plugin provides Sass hinting and autocompletion.\\nSublime CSSComb reorders your CSS and Sass selectors based on criteria that you can specify. I go alphabetically, but you can use any ordering scheme you\\u0026rsquo;d like.\\nThe Color Highlighter plugin displays the color of any hexcode, RGB value, and more when you hover over it. It also works with Sass variables.\\nWorking with HTML Again, there\\u0026rsquo;s not really much you need to do here, but the HTML-CSS-JS Prettify plugin formats your code with proper indentations.\\nDocBlockr I\\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of the DocBlockr format.\\nThe DockBlockr plugin adds the DocBlockr format to JavaScript, PHP, and even CSS files if you type /** and hit enter. It even pulls in variable names from functions and sets up type and description placeholders.\\nServer Files The ApacheConf language plugin adds syntax highlighting to .htaccess files, .conf files, and other server files.\\nToggling Quotes The Toggle Quotes plugin let\\u0026rsquo;s you easily toggle between single and double quotes.\\nClickable Links One thing Code does that I absolutely love is make links in files clickable. The ClickableUrls plugin adds the same functionality to Sublime.\\nUnder Package Settings for this plugin, I had to add this to the user mouse bindings.\\n[ { \\u0026#34;button\\u0026#34;: \\u0026#34;button1\\u0026#34;, \\u0026#34;modifiers\\u0026#34;: [\\u0026#34;super\\u0026#34;], \\u0026#34;press_command\\u0026#34;: \\u0026#34;open_url_under_cursor\\u0026#34; } ]  Syncing Settings The Sync Settings plugin helps keep settings and packages in sync across machines by pushing your configuration to a private GitHub Gist and then checking it on all of your devices.\\nAnything I missed?

In each case, we\\u0026rsquo;ll pass in the props argument to access our template\\u0026rsquo;s state.\\nExample 1: Pass in an existing template To use it, you can pass in an existing template and assign your initial state.\\nvar todoList = function (props) { // Setup our template  var template = \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;; // Loop through the todos  for (var i = 0; i \\u0026lt; props.todos.length; i++) { var todo = props.todos[i]; // Check if it\\u0026#39;s completed  var checked = todo.completed ? \\u0026#39;checked\\u0026#39; : \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;; // Create the todo item  template += \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;label\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39; + \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;input type=\\u0026#34;checkbox\\u0026#34; value=\\u0026#34;\\u0026#39; + todo.item + \\u0026#39;\\u0026#34; \\u0026#39; + checked + \\u0026#39;\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39; + todo.item + \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;/label\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39;; } // Return completed template  return template; }; component(todoList, { todos: [ { item: \\u0026#39;Eat\\u0026#39;, completed: false }, { item: \\u0026#39;Take a nap\\u0026#39;, completed: true }, { item: \\u0026#39;Eat again\\u0026#39;, completed: false } ] }, document.querySelector(\\u0026#39;#todo-list\\u0026#39;));  Our todoList() template is now a component with state, and calling todoList.setState() will cause the associated element to re-render.\\nExample 2: Create the template with the component() method You can alternatively set up a template for the first time with the component() method.\\nvar todoList = component(function (props) { // Setup our template  var template = \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;; // Loop through the todos  for (var i = 0; i \\u0026lt; props.todos.length; i++) { var todo = props.todos[i]; // Check if it\\u0026#39;s completed  var checked = todo.completed ? \\u0026#39;checked\\u0026#39; : \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;; // Create the todo item  template += \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;label\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39; + \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;input type=\\u0026#34;checkbox\\u0026#34; value=\\u0026#34;\\u0026#39; + todo.item + \\u0026#39;\\u0026#34; \\u0026#39; + checked + \\u0026#39;\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39; + todo.item + \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;/label\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39;; } // Return completed template  return template; }, { todos: [ { item: \\u0026#39;Eat\\u0026#39;, completed: false }, { item: \\u0026#39;Take a nap\\u0026#39;, completed: true }, { item: \\u0026#39;Eat again\\u0026#39;, completed: false } ] }, document.querySelector(\\u0026#39;#todo-list\\u0026#39;));  And just like the previous example, calling todoList.setState() will cause a re-render.\\nHow this works The Object.defineProperties() method is used to assign properties to a JavaScript object (and in JavaScript, confusingly, everything is an object, not just actual objects like {}).\\nWhat makes it nicer than just doing object.property = 'something' is that you can also set whether or not people should be able to modify it, if it should show up in loops, and so on.\\nWith our component() method, we\\u0026rsquo;re defining the template\\u0026rsquo;s elem and state properties. We\\u0026rsquo;re also assigning a function to setState(), and automatically passing in in the template\\u0026rsquo;s state property.\\n\",\"summary\":\"I\\u0026rsquo;m getting ready to launch my latest pocket guide, \\u0026ldquo;Vanilla JS Web Apps.\\u0026rdquo;\\nThis week, we\\u0026rsquo;ve looked at how to render elements, add state to an object (and what \\u0026ldquo;state\\u0026rdquo; even is), and how to automatically re-render elements when state changes\\u0026mdash;all without using a framework or library.\\nToday, we\\u0026rsquo;re going to talk about the final piece of the puzzle: how to programmatically turn any template into a component.\\nQuick heads up: if you haven\\u0026rsquo;t yet, you should definitely read the rest of the articles in this series or some of this won\\u0026rsquo;t make sense.\",\"title\":\"Creating web app components with vanilla JavaScript\",\"url\":\"https://gomakethings.com/creating-web-app-components-with-vanilla-javascript/\"},{\"categories\":[\"Code\",\"JavaScript\"],\"content\":\" I\\u0026rsquo;ve been sharing some behind the scenes content from my latest pocket guide, \\u0026ldquo;Vanilla JS Web Apps,\\u0026rdquo; which launches in a couple of weeks.\\nYesterday, we talked about how React and other similar frameworks attach state (a fancy word for \\u0026ldquo;data\\u0026rdquo;) to elements instead of global variables.

It handles merging in your new data for you, and re-renders the component.\\ntodoList.setState({todos: [ { item: \\u0026#39;Eat\\u0026#39;, completed: true }, { item: \\u0026#39;Take a nap\\u0026#39;, completed: true }, { item: \\u0026#39;Eat again\\u0026#39;, completed: false } ]});  Adding the setState() method There\\u0026rsquo;s no native version of this out of the box, but we can add it pretty easily.\\nIn order for this to work, setState() has to know what element to render our component into.\\nYou could pass that in as an argument each time, but an easier way is to store the element as a property on our component. So let\\u0026rsquo;s do that first.\\ntodoList.elem = document.querySelector(\\u0026#39;#todo-list\\u0026#39;);  Now we can add our setState() method.\\ntodoList.setState = function (props) { // Shallow merge new properties into state object \\tfor (var key in props) { if (props.hasOwnProperty(key)) { todoList.state[key] = props[key]; } } // Render the element \\trender(todoList, todoList.elem); // Return the rendered element for use elsewhere \\treturn todoList.elem; };  The example above also returns the rendered element back, so you can do things with it after re-rendering.\\n// Update state var elem = todoList.setState({todos: []}); // Animate the todolist // Note: this won\\u0026#39;t really work.

Here\\u0026rsquo;s what I found.\\nWhy time to first byte? I use DigitalOcean for my hosting. They\\u0026rsquo;re amazing. Their servers are super affordable and super fast.\\n(PS: that link above is an affiliate link that gets you a $10 credit to try them out.)\\nThat said, a few of my plugins involve some heavier server processes that slow things down. With template-based CMS\\u0026rsquo;s like WordPress, running on inexpensive hosting, this can be a large source of latency.\\nI run a caching plugin to pre-render my template files into static HTML, but some plugins can turn this behavior off if they need to always render content dynamically.\\nWhat I found There were three plugins (written by me) that were causing almost all of my performance issues, and all three of them are form plugins that users can use to sign up for my newsletter or get details about my products.\\nTo detect when they\\u0026rsquo;re submitted and make sure a robot isn\\u0026rsquo;t auto-submitting requests to a URL over and over again, I use the wp_nonce_field API.\\nThese fields are not compatible with caching, because they change in value every day or two. After that point, they\\u0026rsquo;ll stop working if users are served an older cached version of the file since the value won\\u0026rsquo;t match.\\nI include an email signup form on almost every page on my site, so for all intents and purposes, caching was turned off on my whole site.\\nWhat I did I ripped out wp_nonce_field from all of the plugin forms, and replaced them with a [NAMESPACE]_submit_id hidden field. Here\\u0026rsquo;s how that works.\\nFirst, I added this to each plugin. It creates a custom hash for our *_submit_id field to use.\\n/** * Create a random submit string hash */ function PLUGIN_NAMESPACE_set_submit_string() { if ( empty( get_site_option( \\u0026#39;PLUGIN_NAMESPACE_submit_hash\\u0026#39; ) ) ) { update_site_option( \\u0026#39;PLUGIN_NAMESPACE_submit_hash\\u0026#39;, wp_generate_password( 24, false ) ); } } add_action( \\u0026#39;plugins_loaded\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;PLUGIN_NAMESPACE_set_submit_string\\u0026#39; ); Then, in our form itself, we\\u0026rsquo;ll add a field with that hash as it\\u0026rsquo;s value.\\n$form = \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;form ...\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39; . \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;input type=\\u0026#34;hidden\\u0026#34; id=\\u0026#34;PLUGIN_NAMESPACE_submit\\u0026#34; name=\\u0026#34;PLUGIN_NAMESPACE_submit\\u0026#34; value=\\u0026#34;\\u0026#39; . get_site_option( \\u0026#39;PLUGIN_NAMESPACE_submit_hash\\u0026#39; ) . \\u0026#39;\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39; . // Additional form stuff... \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;/form\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39;; Finally, on submit, we check that:\\n The field exists, and The value matches our stored value.  /** * Process the form */ function PLUGIN_NAMESPACE_process_form() { // Check that form was submitted if ( !isset( $_POST[\\u0026#39;PLUGIN_NAMESPACE_submit\\u0026#39;] ) ) return; // Verify data came from proper screen if ( strcmp( $_POST[\\u0026#39;PLUGIN_NAMESPACE_submit\\u0026#39;], get_site_option( \\u0026#39;PLUGIN_NAMESPACE_submit_hash\\u0026#39; ) ) !== 0 ) return; // Do the rest of your form tasks... } add_action( \\u0026#39;init\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;PLUGIN_NAMESPACE_process_form\\u0026#39; ); Now, the form can be cached.\\nWhat about success and error messages? The problem with caching the form, of course, is that users won\\u0026rsquo;t get success and error messages after their submission. There\\u0026rsquo;s a way to get around this.\\nMost WordPress caching plugins will ignore URLs with query strings in them, since they often impact the content that\\u0026rsquo;s generated. We can use that to our advantage to force an uncached version of the form after a submit.\\n/** * Process the form */ function PLUGIN_NAMESPACE_process_form() { // Check that form was submitted if ( !isset( $_POST[\\u0026#39;PLUGIN_NAMESPACE_submit\\u0026#39;] ) ) return; // Verify data came from proper screen if ( strcmp( $_POST[\\u0026#39;PLUGIN_NAMESPACE_submit\\u0026#39;], get_site_option( \\u0026#39;PLUGIN_NAMESPACE_submit_hash\\u0026#39; ) ) !== 0 ) return; // Create a cache-breaking URL $referrer = \\u0026#39;the-url-to-your-form.com\\u0026#39;; // How you get this depends on how you\\u0026#39;ve setup your plugin $status_redirect = add_query_arg( \\u0026#39;PLUGIN-NAMESPACE-form\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;submitted\\u0026#39;, $referrer ); // Do the rest of your form tasks... // Redirect and break cache wp_safe_redirect( $status, 302 ); exit; } add_action( \\u0026#39;init\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;PLUGIN_NAMESPACE_process_form\\u0026#39; ); Any downsides to this approach? Because our hidden form field value never changes, someone who wants to spam your form could do so by repeatedly submitting to a static URL with form data.\\nHowever, because that field\\u0026rsquo;s value is being generated uniquely for your site and not shared across anyone who uses the plugin, someone needs to specifically target your site.\\nI also employ additional spam prevention measures like time-based and field-value based honeypots.\\nNow, my entire site is cached, and I\\u0026rsquo;m seeing 700ms start render times again.\\n\",\"summary\":\"Over the last few months, my WordPress site had gone from a rather snappy 700ms start render time to upwards of 3 or 4 seconds.\\nWith a few small changes, I was able to get my start render time back down to 700ms.

How well would that go?\\n And personally, I\\u0026rsquo;ve found that it\\u0026rsquo;s hard to find jobs when you only know HTML and CSS, and the ones you do find pay less.\\nThe reason I started learning JavaScript in the first place was to have more career opportunities\\u0026mdash;and it worked.\\nI have some thoughts First, I\\u0026rsquo;ve never gotten the impression that people feel CSS isn\\u0026rsquo;t important, though Sara has almost certainly had a lot more conversations with people about this topic than I have.\\nI don\\u0026rsquo;t doubt there are people who\\u0026rsquo;ve said something along those lines to her, but I don\\u0026rsquo;t believe it\\u0026rsquo;s the mainstream or norm. I do think there are people who think CSS involves less skill than JavaScript, though.\\nHere\\u0026rsquo;s what I believe is the cause of a lot of this: it\\u0026rsquo;s easier to learn the basics of CSS than the basics of JavaScript, and that has some market implications.\\nThe Basics of CSS vs. JavaScript I think CSS is a bit like skiing, and JavaScript is a bit like snowboarding.\\nCSS is easy to tip-toe into. You can write one line of code and immediately see results.\\nbody { background-color: rebeccapurple; } A lot of it is very plain english in nature, too. background-color. color. width. Those all make sense.\\ndocument.querySelector(). Say what, now?\\nI teach beginner\\u0026rsquo;s JavaScript. Most of the folks I talk to find the basics of JS completely overwhelming.\\nIf you\\u0026rsquo;ve ever tried skiing, the basic mechanics are pretty natural. Face forward, two legs independent, turn to steer. Successfully going down a slope takes you a day or less. Not well, mind you, but you\\u0026rsquo;re moving.\\nLearning snowboarding is hard. You spend the first two days falling over and over again with a plank strapped to your legs. You end the day cold and bruised with almost nothing to show for it.\\nLearning CSS is like learning to ski. Learning JavaScript is like learning to snowboard.\\nThe basics vs. mastery Here\\u0026rsquo;s the thing, though: mastering skiing is a lifetime pursuit.\\nThe basics are easy. Becoming truly good is quite difficult. Same goes for CSS. I know so many senior JavaScript developers who don\\u0026rsquo;t truly understand or appreciate the cascading aspect of CSS (it\\u0026rsquo;s a feature, not a bug).\\nSnowboarding may be hard to learn, but once you pass a certain point (in my experience, being able to go from one edge of the board to another), you advance very rapidly. You can get pretty good in just a season or two.\\nJavaScript is like snowboarding. Hard to learn at first, but easier to master in the long run.\\nThis causes some free market effects What this means is two things:\\n A lot of people who know HTML and CSS, but not JavaScript. A lot of JavaScript developers who know basic CSS.  Right now, the demand for JavaScript developers is high, the supply is lower than that of CSS developers, and as such, pay for JS roles is higher.\\nYou also unfortunately see companies relying far too much on JS developers to write CSS, which results in bloated, poorly written CSS that doesn\\u0026rsquo;t scale well.\\nIt also causes an over-reliance on JS for things that would more easily be solved with HTML and CSS alone.\\nCSS and JavaScript are equals As projects scale, you cannot downplay the importance of scalable CSS. It\\u0026rsquo;s the difference between slow, buggy projects and fast, easily maintainable ones.\\nThere are JavaScript developers who are very competent CSS developers as well.\\nBut, things like the movement towards CSS-in-JS this year show me that, as a whole, the sub-field of JavaScript doesn\\u0026rsquo;t really understand CSS that well.\\nI\\u0026rsquo;d love to see more organizations value senior CSS roles in the same way that they do senior JavaScript roles.\\n\",\"summary\":\"This week, Mandy Michael published the very good, provocatively titled, \\u0026ldquo;Is there any value in people who cannot write JavaScript?\\u0026rdquo;\\n We’d just finished a set of talks about CSS, and during the panel we got a question along the lines of (paraphrasing): “Is there a place in the industry for people who just write css and html”\\u0026hellip; What I am very concerned about is that many still don’t see value in being skilled in CSS \\u0026amp; HTML.\",\"title\":\"CSS vs. JavaScript\",\"url\":\"https://gomakethings.com/css-vs-javascript/\"},{\"categories\":[\"Code\",\"JavaScript\"],\"content\":\" This week, I\\u0026rsquo;m sharing topics from my next pocket guide: Vanilla JS Web Apps.\\nLet\\u0026rsquo;s take what we learned over the last few days and use it to build a clock with vanilla JavaScript.\\nThe Setup First, we\\u0026rsquo;ll pull in our render() function.\\nvar render = function (template, node) { if (!node) return; node.innerHTML = (typeof template === \\u0026#39;function\\u0026#39; ? template() : template); var event = new CustomEvent(\\u0026#39;elementRenders\\u0026#39;, { bubbles: true }); node.dispatchEvent(event); return node; };  We\\u0026rsquo;ll also create an empty \\u0026lt;div\\u0026gt; with the ID #clock.\\n\\u0026lt;div id=\\u0026#34;clock\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt; Now we\\u0026rsquo;re ready to build our clock!\\nSetting the time When the page loads, we\\u0026rsquo;ll render the current time using new Date() to generate a time string, and toLocaleTimeString() to convert it to the user\\u0026rsquo;s local time.\\nWe\\u0026rsquo;ll inject it with the render() function.\\nrender(\\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;h1\\u0026gt;The time is \\u0026#39; + new Date().toLocaleTimeString() + \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;/h1\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39;, document.querySelector(\\u0026#39;#clock\\u0026#39;));  Here\\u0026rsquo;s a demo.\\nUpdating the time That\\u0026rsquo;s a great start, but we want the time to automatically update every second.

Today, we\\u0026rsquo;re going to look at how to render content with vanilla JavaScript.\\nLet\\u0026rsquo;s get to it!\\nThe render() method React has a function called render() that let\\u0026rsquo;s you pass in a template and the element to render it into, and it handles the rest.\\nWe can create something similar with just a few lines of vanilla JavaScript. First, let\\u0026rsquo;s set up our render() method.\\nvar render = function (template, node) { // Codes goes here... };  This follows the same structure as React, where you pass in a template and the node to render it into.\\nTo render content, we\\u0026rsquo;ll use innerHTML, a property that let\\u0026rsquo;s you set the inner HTML of an element.\\nvar render = function (template, node) { node.innerHTML = template; };  Now, we can render content like this:\\nvar template = \\u0026#39;\\u0026lt;h1\\u0026gt;Hello world!\\u0026lt;/h1\\u0026gt;\\u0026#39;; render(template, document.querySelector(\\u0026#39;#main\\u0026#39;));  Here\\u0026rsquo;s a working demo.\\nChecking that the node exists One thing we should do is make sure a node exists before trying to set it\\u0026rsquo;s innerHTML. Otherwise, we might throw an error.\\nWe\\u0026rsquo;ll simply check that node was provided and exists, and if not, return to end our function.\\nvar render = function (template, node) { if (!node) return; node.innerHTML = template; };  Why a node instead of a selector? I originally thought of passing in a selector instead of a node, and using querySelector() to get the node inside our render() function. That would certainly be easier.\\nvar render = function (template, selector) { var node = document.querySelector(selector); if (!node) return; node.innerHTML = template; }; render(template, \\u0026#39;#main\\u0026#39;);  There are two reasons you wouldn\\u0026rsquo;t want to do this.\\n If you\\u0026rsquo;ve already gotten the node (to add a class or data attribute, for example), there\\u0026rsquo;s no reason to re-query it in the DOM. You may want to render content into an element you created but haven\\u0026rsquo;t injected into the DOM yet.  What now? That\\u0026rsquo;s a basic render() function.

They achieve the same outcome as callbacks\\u0026mdash;making my code more flexible\\u0026mdash;but offer some unique advantages (and disadvantages).\\nHow to emit a custom event Custom events are actually really easy to create.\\nFirst, use new CustomEvent() to create the event, passing in the name of the event. Then, use call dispatchEvent() on the element you want to attach the event to, passing in your new custom event.\\nvar makeBlue = function (elem) { elem.classList.add(\\u0026#39;blue\\u0026#39;); // Create a new event  var event = new CustomEvent(\\u0026#39;madeBlue\\u0026#39;); // Dispatch the event  elem.dispatchEvent(event); };  You can listen for custom events just like regular events (click, scroll, etc.) using addEventListener().\\nvar elem = document.querySelector(\\u0026#39;.not-blue\\u0026#39;); makeBlue(elem); // Run function on `madeBlue` event elem.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;madeBlue\\u0026#39;, function (elem) { elem.classList.add(\\u0026#39;color-changed\\u0026#39;); }, false);  The benefits of using custom events Why use this approach?\\nCustom events let you pull the function you want to run afterwards out of the script itself. You can include an event listener in a different script or file, and attach multiple event listeners to the same event.\\nImagine you had two separate scripts that you want to run after makeBlue() ran, With a callback, those functions would have to be passed in to makeBlue(). With custom events, they can reside in any file or script.\\nThis is particularly useful when working with multiple plugins or multiple developers.\\nThe downside Callbacks are synchronous. When called, your function holds all other processes until the callback function is run.\\nCustom events stop the rest of a script from running while they dispatch, but any functions that listen for them run asynchronously.\\nOften not a big deal, but if you need to stop other code from running until the callback is complete, custom events aren\\u0026rsquo;t the right call.\\nBrowser support CustomEvent doesn\\u0026rsquo;t show up until IE 11 and Safari 10.

The front-end development field, and JavaScript in particular, has a toolset problem.\\nThe pace of change is part of what makes this industry so exciting, but this obsession we seem to have with tools (and creating new ones) instead of maturing what we\\u0026rsquo;ve already got it is exhausting. You don\\u0026rsquo;t see the same level of tool churn on the backend.\\nI\\u0026rsquo;ve done a few things to help both inoculate myself from the madness and focus on the right things.\\n Just-in-time learning. Vanilla JavaScript first. Stable technology over \\\"the new hotness.\\\" Targeted listening.  Let\\u0026rsquo;s dig deeper into each of these approaches, and how I use them to stay sane in a rapidly moving field.\\nJust-in-time learning Rather than trying to learn all the new things that come out, I dig into new tools if and when I need them. This is a trick I picked up from Sara Soueidan.\\nFor example, CSS grids and flexbox are old news at this point, but I still don\\u0026rsquo;t know how to use them. Old fashion floating div grids have served me \\u0026ldquo;good enough\\u0026rdquo; for the designs I\\u0026rsquo;ve implemented, so the gains from using the newer technology aren\\u0026rsquo;t worth the time and stress spent trying to grok it.\\nSame goes for Fetch instead of XHR for Ajax in the JavaScript world.\\nI make sure I know about new technologies and techniques, even if I don\\u0026rsquo;t learn how they work until I need them. This helps me figure out what to focus on and use, and when.\\nVanilla JavaScript First Frameworks and libraries come and go, but they\\u0026rsquo;re always built on top of vanilla JavaScript. I use vanilla JS (with polyfills if needed) whenever I can, and defer to libraries and frameworks when they make the project easier or better.\\nKnowing vanilla JS deeply also helps me pick up new tools more quickly, and better evaluate their strengths and weaknesses.\\nBrowser-native (aka vanilla) JavaScript is evolving so rapidly, and filling many of the gaps that we previously needed libraries and frameworks for. These days, I\\u0026rsquo;m finding less and less reasons to use anything besides vanilla JS.\\nStable technology over \\\"the new hotness\\\" There\\u0026rsquo;s a tendency in our field to jump onto the new thing constantly.\\n Use Grunt! No, now it's Gulp. WordPress all the things. Nope, now Jekyll for static sites. No, now Hugo.  It\\u0026rsquo;s exhausting!\\nI\\u0026rsquo;ve learned that less sexy, more stable technology is a blessing. Less bugs, better documentation, more resources. And, organizations prefer to work with trusted, stable technology as well.\\nNow, I ignore the noise.\\nIf I were thinking about JS frameworks for a project today, I think I\\u0026rsquo;d basically only consider Angular and React (and skew towards React). The rest is just noise.\\nTargeted Listening When I was first applying for web developer roles, I talked to a UX director who told me,\\n \\\"Mobile is a fad, and one that I think is almost over. No one wants to do [thing they built] on their phones.\\\"  I immediately ended the interview and said it wasn\\u0026rsquo;t a good fit (seriously).\\nIn the course of interviewing for roles, I ran into numerous people who shared this view, or just didn\\u0026rsquo;t know about RWD. This wasn\\u0026rsquo;t that long ago. It was 2013, and that point, RWD was already mainstream, if not 100% the norm.\\nI want to make sure I\\u0026rsquo;m never that old developer who misses a trend because I write it off as \\u0026ldquo;just a fad.\\u0026rdquo; I don\\u0026rsquo;t want to become obsolete.

Sara Soueidan. You get the idea.\\nWhen they talk about emerging technology, I know it\\u0026rsquo;s important to pay attention to.\\nI also use Twitter, conferences, and in-person contacts to find people who do roles I think I may want to move into and learn more about their roles. I ask them what the emerging trends are, and how they seem their role changing as a result.\\nIn addition to forming relationships with some awesome people, I get to learn about what other people do, what\\u0026rsquo;s important to them, what sort of things they see happening and changing how they work, and so on.\\nIt\\u0026rsquo;s always super informative.\\nWhat about you?

You can optionally filter sibling elements by a selector as well (for example, only returning elements with a certain class or data attribute).\\nToday, let\\u0026rsquo;s build a vanilla JS version of this.\\nSetting up our function First, let\\u0026rsquo;s create a function named nextUntil().\\nvar nextUntil = function () { // Code goes here... };  Next, let\\u0026rsquo;s pass in a few arguments.\\nWe need to know the element to start our search with. We also need to know what selector to check for and stop at (the \\u0026ldquo;until\\u0026rdquo; part of the script).\\nvar nextUntil = function (elem, selector) { // Code goes here... };  Now we\\u0026rsquo;re ready to start coding.\\nGetting sibling elements First, let\\u0026rsquo;s setup an array to push our sibling elements into.\\nvar nextUntil = function (elem, selector) { // Setup siblings array \\tvar siblings = []; };  Then, we\\u0026rsquo;ll get the first sibling for our starting element. To do this, we\\u0026rsquo;ll use the nextElementSibling property. There\\u0026rsquo;s also a nextSibling property, but this returns all types of nodes (text strings, for example), and we only want elements.\\nvar nextUntil = function (elem, selector) { // Setup siblings array \\tvar siblings = []; // Get the next sibling element \\telem = elem.nextElementSibling; };  Now that we\\u0026rsquo;ve got our first sibling, we want to do a few things:\\n Make sure it doesn\\u0026rsquo;t match our selector. Add it to the list of siblings. Get the next sibling element.  We\\u0026rsquo;ll wrap all of this functionality in a while loop.\\nwhile loops run as long as the condition you\\u0026rsquo;ve specified is true. In our case, we\\u0026rsquo;ll reset the elem variable to the next sibling, and as long as an elem exists, we\\u0026rsquo;ll continue looping through.\\nWe\\u0026rsquo;ll use matches() to check if the element has our selector or not, and push() to add the current element in the loop to our array.\\nvar nextUntil = function (elem, selector) { // Setup siblings array \\tvar siblings = []; // Get the next sibling element \\telem = elem.nextElementSibling; // As long as a sibling exists \\twhile (elem) { // If we\\u0026#39;ve reached our match, bail \\tif (elem.matches(selector)) break; // Otherwise, push it to the siblings array \\tsiblings.push(elem); // Get the next sibling element \\telem = elem.nextElementSibling; } };  Once our loop is done, we can return the siblings array.\\nvar nextUntil = function (elem, selector) { // Setup siblings array \\tvar siblings = []; // Get the next sibling element \\telem = elem.nextElementSibling; // As long as a sibling exists \\twhile (elem) { // If we\\u0026#39;ve reached our match, bail \\tif (elem.matches(selector)) break; // Otherwise, push it to the siblings array \\tsiblings.push(elem); // Get the next sibling element \\telem = elem.nextElementSibling; } return siblings; };  Looking good so far!\\nOptional filter The jQuery version of nextUntil() let\\u0026rsquo;s you filter your siblings by a selector. I\\u0026rsquo;d like to support that, too.\\nFirst, we\\u0026rsquo;ll add a new argument to our function.\\nvar nextUntil = function (elem, selector, filter) { // ... };  Then, in our loop, after we check to see if the element matches our selector, we\\u0026rsquo;ll check to see if a filter was specified. If it was, we\\u0026rsquo;ll then check to see if the element matches the filter.\\nIf it doesn\\u0026rsquo;t, we\\u0026rsquo;ll skip to the next sibling element. Otherwise, we\\u0026rsquo;ll carry on as normal.\\nvar nextUntil = function (elem, selector, filter) { // Setup siblings array \\tvar siblings = []; // Get the next sibling element \\telem = elem.nextElementSibling; // As long as a sibling exists \\twhile (elem) { // If we\\u0026#39;ve reached our match, bail \\tif (elem.matches(selector)) break; // If filtering by a selector, check if the sibling matches \\tif (filter \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; !elem.matches(filter)) { elem = elem.nextElementSibling; continue; } // Otherwise, push it to the siblings array \\tsiblings.push(elem); // Get the next sibling element \\telem = elem.nextElementSibling; } return siblings; };  Polyfilling matches() The matches() method was implemented with a browser prefix in some older browsers. A simple polyfill normalizes behavior in older versions of webkit and MS browsers.\\nLet\\u0026rsquo;s add one to our script to ensure maximum cross-browser compatibility. This brings us to IE9+.\\nvar nextUntil = function (elem, selector, filter) { // matches() polyfill \\tif (!Element.prototype.matches) { Element.prototype.matches = Element.prototype.msMatchesSelector || Element.prototype.webkitMatchesSelector; } // Setup siblings array \\tvar siblings = []; // Get the next sibling element \\telem = elem.nextElementSibling; // As long as a sibling exists \\twhile (elem) { // If we\\u0026#39;ve reached our match, bail \\tif (elem.matches(selector)) break; // If filtering by a selector, check if the sibling matches \\tif (filter \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; !elem.matches(filter)) { elem = elem.nextElementSibling; continue; } // Otherwise, push it to the siblings array \\tsiblings.push(elem); // Get the next sibling element \\telem = elem.nextElementSibling; } return siblings; };  And that\\u0026rsquo;s it!

Specifically, we\\u0026rsquo;re listening for the transitionend event on our element.\\nSo in our show() method, this\\u0026hellip;\\n// Once the transition is complete, remove the inline height so the content can scale responsively window.setTimeout(function () { elem.style.height = \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;; }, timing);  Becomes this\\u0026hellip;\\n// Once the transition is complete, remove the inline height so the content can scale responsively window.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;transitionend\\u0026#39;, function () { elem.style.height = \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;; }, false);  And in our hide() method, this\\u0026hellip;\\n// When the transition is complete, hide it window.setTimeout(function () { elem.classList.remove(\\u0026#39;is-visible\\u0026#39;); }, timing);  Becomes this\\u0026hellip;\\n// When the transition is complete, hide it window.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;transitionend\\u0026#39;, function () { elem.classList.remove(\\u0026#39;is-visible\\u0026#39;); }, false);  We can also remove our getTiming() method, since we\\u0026rsquo;re automatically detecting the transition end now.\\nHere\\u0026rsquo;s a demo of what we\\u0026rsquo;ve got so far.\\nRemoving our event listeners after they run One thing you might notice about the demo above is that if you open some content, close it, and then try to open it again, it automatically closes itself.\\nEach click is adding an event listener, so we have multiple listeners running and competing with each other. We need to remove our listener after it runs.\\nTo do that, we\\u0026rsquo;ll give our listener a named function instead of an anonymous one.\\n// Once the transition is complete, remove the inline height so the content can scale responsively window.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;transitionend\\u0026#39;, function removeHeight () { elem.style.height = \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;; }, false);  Then we\\u0026rsquo;ll remove it with removeEventListener() after it runs. removeEventListener() requires a named function and all of the same exact parameters to work properly.\\n// Once the transition is complete, remove the inline height so the content can scale responsively window.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;transitionend\\u0026#39;, function removeHeight () { elem.style.height = \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;; window.removeEventListener(\\u0026#39;transitionend\\u0026#39;, removeHeight, false); }, false);  We\\u0026rsquo;ll do the same thing under our hide() method.\\n// When the transition is complete, hide it window.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;transitionend\\u0026#39;, function removeVisibility () { elem.classList.remove(\\u0026#39;is-visible\\u0026#39;); window.removeEventListener(\\u0026#39;transitionend\\u0026#39;, removeVisibility, false); }, false);  Here\\u0026rsquo;s a demo with our updated script.\\nChecking for the transition type In our simple demo, we know exactly what transitions are happening on the element and can be certain the first one is what we want to trigger our behavior.\\nIn a real website or app, that might not be the case. To make our code more resilient, we should check to see which transition type is happening and only run it if it\\u0026rsquo;s for height.\\nTo accomplish this, we\\u0026rsquo;ll pass in event as an argument into our function and check the propertyName property.\\n// Once the transition is complete, remove the inline max-height so the content can scale responsively window.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;transitionend\\u0026#39;, function removeHeight (event) { if (!event.propertyName === \\u0026#39;height\\u0026#39;) return; elem.style.height = \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;; window.removeEventListener(\\u0026#39;transitionend\\u0026#39;, removeHeight, false); }, false);  Here, we\\u0026rsquo;re checking to see if the propertyName is height. If not, we bail on our function. We\\u0026rsquo;ll do the same thing with our hide() method.\\n// When the transition is complete, hide it window.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;transitionend\\u0026#39;, function removeVisibility (event) { if (!event.propertyName === \\u0026#39;height\\u0026#39;) return; elem.classList.remove(\\u0026#39;is-visible\\u0026#39;); window.removeEventListener(\\u0026#39;transitionend\\u0026#39;, removeVisibility, false); }, false);  Here\\u0026rsquo;s a demo with the transition type check in place.\\nEvent Prefixes Older versions of Chrome, Android, Webkit, Safari, and Opera used vendor-prefixed versions of transitionend (ex. webkitTransitionEnd).\\nThe affected browsers are many versions old at this point, but if you want to ensure that even someone using a version of Chrome or Opera that\\u0026rsquo;s dozens of versions behind can use your code, there\\u0026rsquo;s a method we can add to determine which event to listen for (shoutout to Diego for sharing this part, as well).\\n// Get the event name // Adapted from Modernizr: https://modernizr.com var whichTransitionEvent = function () { var el = document.createElement(\\u0026#39;fakeelement\\u0026#39;); var transitions = { \\u0026#39;transition\\u0026#39;: \\u0026#39;transitionend\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;OTransition\\u0026#39;: \\u0026#39;oTransitionEnd\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;MozTransition\\u0026#39;: \\u0026#39;transitionend\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;WebkitTransition\\u0026#39;: \\u0026#39;webkitTransitionEnd\\u0026#39; } for (var t in transitions) { if (el.style[t] !== undefined) { return transitions[t]; } } };  Then in our show() and hide() methods, we\\u0026rsquo;ll do this.\\n// Get transition type var transition = whichTransitionEvent(); // Once the transition is complete, remove the inline max-height so the content can scale responsively window.addEventListener(transition, function removeHeight (event) { if (!event.propertyName === \\u0026#39;height\\u0026#39;) return; elem.style.height = \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;; window.removeEventListener(transition, removeHeight, false); }, false);  Given how old the affect browsers are, I\\u0026rsquo;ll personally stick to the standard event names only, but your use case may vary.\\nPutting it all together Here\\u0026rsquo;s our completed script (without vendor prefixes).\\n// Show an element var show = function (elem) { // Get the natural height of the element \\tvar getHeight = function () { elem.style.display = \\u0026#39;block\\u0026#39;; // Make it visible \\tvar height = elem.scrollHeight + \\u0026#39;px\\u0026#39;; // Get it\\u0026#39;s height \\telem.style.display = \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;; // Hide it again \\treturn height; }; var height = getHeight(); // Get the natural height \\telem.classList.add(\\u0026#39;is-visible\\u0026#39;); // Make the element visible \\telem.style.height = height; // Update the max-height  // Once the transition is complete, remove the inline max-height so the content can scale responsively \\twindow.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;transitionend\\u0026#39;, function removeHeight (event) { if (!event.propertyName === \\u0026#39;height\\u0026#39;) return; elem.style.height = \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;; window.removeEventListener(\\u0026#39;transitionend\\u0026#39;, removeHeight, false); }, false); }; // Hide an element var hide = function (elem) { // Give the element a height to change from \\telem.style.height = elem.scrollHeight + \\u0026#39;px\\u0026#39;; // Set the height back to 0 \\twindow.setTimeout(function () { elem.style.height = \\u0026#39;0\\u0026#39;; }, 1); // When the transition is complete, hide it \\twindow.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;transitionend\\u0026#39;, function removeVisibility (event) { if (!event.propertyName === \\u0026#39;height\\u0026#39;) return; elem.classList.remove(\\u0026#39;is-visible\\u0026#39;); window.removeEventListener(\\u0026#39;transitionend\\u0026#39;, removeVisibility, false); }, false); }; // Toggle element visibility var toggle = function (elem, timing) { // If the element is visible, hide it \\tif (elem.classList.contains(\\u0026#39;is-visible\\u0026#39;)) { hide(elem); return; } // Otherwise, show it \\tshow(elem); }; \",\"summary\":\"Yesterday, we looked at two techniques for adjusting the timing of transitions for our vanilla JS show() and hide() methods.

If they\\u0026rsquo;re the same length, the change isn\\u0026rsquo;t visible, so we let it complete a little bit after the height is completed.\\nHere\\u0026rsquo;s a demo.\\n\",\"summary\":\"Last week, we created some simple show() and hide() methods, and added a transition animation to them.\\nOne of my readers mentioned that adding a fade in effect would be a nice visual touch, so today, let\\u0026rsquo;s look at how to do that.\\nIt\\u0026rsquo;s all CSS The good news is that this can be done entirely with CSS.\\nFirst, we\\u0026rsquo;ll add a default opacity of 0 to our .toggle-content class, and an opacity of 1 when the .\",\"title\":\"How to a fade in to vanilla JavaScript show and hide methods\",\"url\":\"https://gomakethings.com/how-to-a-fade-in-to-vanilla-javascript-show-and-hide-methods/\"},{\"categories\":[\"Code\",\"CSS\",\"JavaScript\"],\"content\":\" Yesterday, we looked at how to show and hide elements with vanilla JavaScript.\\nTo recap, we can either add an inline display style with the style property, or toggle a class that controls visibility using classList.\\nToday, let\\u0026rsquo;s learn how to add transitions.\\nAdding transitions Adding transitions is where things get just a bit more complicated.\\nLet\\u0026rsquo;s say you wanted to animate the expansion or collapse of your content like jQuery does. You might try adding a height property of 0, and changing it to auto when .is-visible is added.\\n.toggle-content { display: none; height: 0; transition: height 350ms ease-in-out; } .toggle-content.is-visible { display: block; height: auto; } Unfortunately, that won\\u0026rsquo;t work. CSS transitions require fixed values, and will not animate auto values.\\nOne commonly proposed solution is to use max-height instead of height, and set the expanded value to something really large like 999em.\\n.toggle-content { display: none; max-height: 0; overflow: hidden; transition: max-height 350ms ease-in-out; } .toggle-content.is-visible { display: block; max-height: 999em; } If you check out this demo, you\\u0026rsquo;ll notice that the max-height isn\\u0026rsquo;t animating.\\nThe problem is with the display property.\\nBecause the display property is set to none, and then changes to block, the change in max-height is never triggered in the browser. From the browser\\u0026rsquo;s perspective, it has no set max-height until it\\u0026rsquo;s displayed.\\nIf we remove the display property, you\\u0026rsquo;ll notice it works, sort of (here\\u0026rsquo;s a demo).\\n.toggle-content { max-height: 0; overflow: hidden; transition: max-height 2000ms ease-in-out; } .toggle-content.is-visible { max-height: 999em; } There are two problems with this approach.\\n The animation is barely visible. There\\u0026rsquo;s a weird lag before the element collapses.  Both of these are caused by large max-height property with the .is-visible class.\\nRegardless of the rendered height of the element, the browser runs the animation over the full height of the max-height.\\nFor short pieces of content, the animation is barely perceptible because it happens so fast. And when closing the content, the animation first runs over the non-existent extra height in that max-height before getting to the real content.\\nYou could make that height smaller, but you run the risk of having content clipped if it\\u0026rsquo;s too tall for the container on smaller viewports. And there\\u0026rsquo;s accessibility issues with having content with a max-height of 0 but still displayed in the DOM.\\nWe need a more elegant solution.\\nUsing JavaScript to dynamically calculate our height To make this all work, we want to do two things:\\n Dynamically calculate the height of our element, so that the browser has an actually height value to animate. We\\u0026rsquo;ll add this inline to our element Delay changing the display property until after the animation is complete.  First, let\\u0026rsquo;s update our CSS.\\nWe\\u0026rsquo;ll add the display back. We\\u0026rsquo;ll switch max-height back to height, and give it a value of auto when the content is visible. We\\u0026rsquo;ll be using JavaScript to add this as content-specific inline CSS for us.\\n.toggle-content { display: none; height: 0; overflow: hidden; transition: height 350ms ease-in-out; } .toggle-content.is-visible { display: block; height: auto; } Showing an element To show an element, we first need to get it\\u0026rsquo;s natural height (it\\u0026rsquo;s height when it\\u0026rsquo;s not hidden). Let\\u0026rsquo;s create a function named getHeight() to handle this for us.\\nFirst, we\\u0026rsquo;ll set the element\\u0026rsquo;s display to block.\\nThen we\\u0026rsquo;ll get it\\u0026rsquo;s height using scrollHeight, which tells you the height of an element\\u0026rsquo;s content, and store it to a variable. This returns an integer, so we\\u0026rsquo;ll need to add px to the end to use with our inline style.\\nFinally, we\\u0026rsquo;ll hide our element again by removing the display property, and return our height value.\\n// Get the natural height of the element var getHeight = function () { elem.style.display = \\u0026#39;block\\u0026#39;; // Make it visible \\tvar height = elem.scrollHeight + \\u0026#39;px\\u0026#39;; // Get it\\u0026#39;s height \\telem.style.display = \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;; // Hide it again \\treturn height; };  Even though we\\u0026rsquo;re showing and then re-hiding our content, it never shows visibly for users because the function runs so quickly (just a few milliseconds) and thus never actually renders visually in the DOM.\\nNext, we want to do three things:\\n Actually run getHeight to calculate the element\\u0026rsquo;s natural height. Add the .is-visible class to our element to update it\\u0026rsquo;s display property. Set it\\u0026rsquo;s height as an inline property.  var show = function (elem) { // Get the natural height of the element \\tvar getHeight = function () { elem.style.display = \\u0026#39;block\\u0026#39;; // Make it visible \\tvar height = elem.scrollHeight + \\u0026#39;px\\u0026#39;; // Get it\\u0026#39;s height \\telem.style.display = \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;; // Hide it again \\treturn height; }; var height = getHeight(); // Get the natural height \\telem.classList.add(\\u0026#39;is-visible\\u0026#39;); // Make the element visible \\telem.style.height = height; // Update the max-height  };  There\\u0026rsquo;s one last thing we should do: remove the inline height property after the animation is complete. If we leave it and someone resizes the browser, the content container could be too tall, or worse, too short and clip the content.\\nWe\\u0026rsquo;ll use setTimeout() to create a function that we run after our animation finishes. The first argument in setTimeout() is our function, where we\\u0026rsquo;ll remove the inline height property. The second is how far out, in milliseconds, to run that function.\\nvar show = function (elem) { // Get the natural height of the element \\tvar getHeight = function () { elem.style.display = \\u0026#39;block\\u0026#39;; // Make it visible \\tvar height = elem.scrollHeight + \\u0026#39;px\\u0026#39;; // Get it\\u0026#39;s height \\telem.style.display = \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;; // Hide it again \\treturn height; }; var height = getHeight(); // Get the natural height \\telem.classList.add(\\u0026#39;is-visible\\u0026#39;); // Make the element visible \\telem.style.height = height; // Update the max-height  // Once the transition is complete, remove the inline max-height so the content can scale responsively \\twindow.setTimeout(function () { elem.style.height = \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;; }, 350); };  So far, so good!\\nHiding and element Visible elements, once animated, have a height of auto. To animate hiding them, we need to give them a fixed height to animate down to 0.\\nLet\\u0026rsquo;s again calculate the natural height of the element with scrollHeight and add it as an inline style.\\nvar hide = function (elem) { // Give the element a height to change from \\telem.style.height = elem.scrollHeight + \\u0026#39;px\\u0026#39;; };  Next, we want to set our height back to 0. But, if we run it too quickly, the browser won\\u0026rsquo;t detect the change at all and won\\u0026rsquo;t run. We\\u0026rsquo;ll use setTimeout() with a 1 millisecond delay to make sure the change registers.\\nvar hide = function (elem) { // Give the element a height to change from \\telem.style.height = elem.scrollHeight + \\u0026#39;px\\u0026#39;; // Set the height back to 0 \\twindow.setTimeout(function () { elem.style.height = \\u0026#39;0\\u0026#39;; }, 1); };  When the animation completes, we can remove our .is-visible class to set display to none again.\\nvar hide = function (elem) { // Give the element a height to change from \\telem.style.height = elem.scrollHeight + \\u0026#39;px\\u0026#39;; // Set the height back to 0 \\twindow.setTimeout(function () { elem.style.height = \\u0026#39;0\\u0026#39;; }, 1); // When the transition is complete, hide it \\twindow.setTimeout(function () { elem.classList.remove(\\u0026#39;is-visible\\u0026#39;); }, 350); };  Toggling an element\\u0026rsquo;s visibility The last thing we need to do is add a method to toggle visibility.\\nFor this one, we\\u0026rsquo;ll check to see if our element has the .is-visible class. If it does, it\\u0026rsquo;s already visible and we\\u0026rsquo;ll run our hide() method. Otherwise, we\\u0026rsquo;ll run our show() method.\\nvar toggle = function (elem, timing) { // If the element is visible, hide it \\tif (elem.classList.contains(\\u0026#39;is-visible\\u0026#39;)) { hide(elem); return; } // Otherwise, show it \\tshow(elem); };  Putting it all together Here\\u0026rsquo;s the whole thing together.\\n// Show an element var show = function (elem) { // Get the natural height of the element \\tvar getHeight = function () { elem.style.display = \\u0026#39;block\\u0026#39;; // Make it visible \\tvar height = elem.scrollHeight + \\u0026#39;px\\u0026#39;; // Get it\\u0026#39;s height \\telem.style.display = \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;; // Hide it again \\treturn height; }; var height = getHeight(); // Get the natural height \\telem.classList.add(\\u0026#39;is-visible\\u0026#39;); // Make the element visible \\telem.style.height = height; // Update the max-height  // Once the transition is complete, remove the inline max-height so the content can scale responsively \\twindow.setTimeout(function () { elem.style.height = \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;; }, 350); }; // Hide an element var hide = function (elem) { // Give the element a height to change from \\telem.style.height = elem.scrollHeight + \\u0026#39;px\\u0026#39;; // Set the height back to 0 \\twindow.setTimeout(function () { elem.style.height = \\u0026#39;0\\u0026#39;; }, 1); // When the transition is complete, hide it \\twindow.setTimeout(function () { elem.classList.remove(\\u0026#39;is-visible\\u0026#39;); }, 350); }; // Toggle element visibility var toggle = function (elem, timing) { // If the element is visible, hide it \\tif (elem.classList.contains(\\u0026#39;is-visible\\u0026#39;)) { hide(elem); return; } // Otherwise, show it \\tshow(elem); };  Check out a working demo here.\\n\",\"summary\":\"Yesterday, we looked at how to show and hide elements with vanilla JavaScript.\\nTo recap, we can either add an inline display style with the style property, or toggle a class that controls visibility using classList.\\nToday, let\\u0026rsquo;s learn how to add transitions.\\nAdding transitions Adding transitions is where things get just a bit more complicated.\\nLet\\u0026rsquo;s say you wanted to animate the expansion or collapse of your content like jQuery does.\",\"title\":\"How to add transition animations to vanilla JavaScript show and hide methods\",\"url\":\"https://gomakethings.com/how-to-add-transition-animations-to-vanilla-javascript-show-and-hide-methods/\"},{\"categories\":[\"Code\",\"CSS\",\"JavaScript\"],\"content\":\" This week in my private Vanilla JS Slack channel (available to people who purchase one of my pocket guides), one of my students asked me how to replicate jQuery\\u0026rsquo;s show(), hide(), and toggle() methods with vanilla JavaScript.\\nShowing and hiding elements with vanilla JS is pretty straightforward.

It gives you more control, and is faster for the browser to render.\\nYou can name the class anything you want, but for our purposes, we\\u0026rsquo;ll use .is-visible.\\nThe classList set of methods let us add, remove, and toggle classes, so this approach requires no logic. The browser does all of the heavy lifting for us.\\n// Show an element var show = function (elem) { elem.classList.add(\\u0026#39;is-visible\\u0026#39;); }; // Hide an element var hide = function (elem) { elem.classList.remove(\\u0026#39;is-visible\\u0026#39;); }; // Toggle element visibility var toggle = function (elem) { elem.classList.toggle(\\u0026#39;is-visible\\u0026#39;); };  We also need to add some CSS to control our content visibility.\\n.toggle-content { display: none; } .toggle-content.is-visible { display: block; } Here\\u0026rsquo;s a demo using classes to toggle visibility.\\nThe nice thing about this approach is that you can easily set the default visibility of an element.

One thing I neglected to mention: getComputedStyle() can only be used to get values, not set them.\\nToday, let\\u0026rsquo;s look at how to set CSS with vanilla JS.\\nApproach 1: Inline Styles The easiest way to set an element\\u0026rsquo;s style with JavaScript is using the style property.\\nJavaScript uses camel case instead of a dash for property names (you can view a full list of properties on MDN), but it\\u0026rsquo;s pretty straightforward otherwise:\\nvar elem = document.querySelector(\\u0026#39;#some-element\\u0026#39;); // Set color to purple elem.style.color = \\u0026#39;purple\\u0026#39;; // Set the background color to a light gray elem.style.backgroundColor = \\u0026#39;#e5e5e5\\u0026#39;; // Set the height to 150px elem.style.height = \\u0026#39;150px\\u0026#39;;  The style property adds styles inline on the element.\\n\\u0026lt;div id=\\u0026#34;some-element\\u0026#34; style=\\u0026#34;color: purple; background-color: #e5e5e5; height: 150px;\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt; Hello, world! \\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt; This can make your markup pretty messy, though. It\\u0026rsquo;s also less performant for browsers to render.\\nApproach 2: Adding Global Styles An alternate approach is to inject a \\u0026lt;style\\u0026gt; element with your CSS properties into the DOM. This is useful when setting styles that should apply to a set of elements instead of just a single one.\\nFirst, we\\u0026rsquo;ll create a style element.\\nvar style = document.createElement(\\u0026#39;style\\u0026#39;);  Next, we\\u0026rsquo;ll add our styles by giving the style an innerHTML.\\nvar style = document.createElement(\\u0026#39;style\\u0026#39;); style.innerHTML = \\u0026#39;.some-element {\\u0026#39; + \\u0026#39;color: purple;\\u0026#39; + \\u0026#39;background-color: #e5e5e5;\\u0026#39; + \\u0026#39;height: 150px;\\u0026#39; + \\u0026#39;}\\u0026#39;;  Finally, we\\u0026rsquo;ll inject the styles into the DOM. To do this, we\\u0026rsquo;ll grab the first script tag we find in the DOM and use insertBefore() to add our style tag before it.\\n// Create our stylesheet var style = document.createElement(\\u0026#39;style\\u0026#39;); style.innerHTML = \\u0026#39;.some-element {\\u0026#39; + \\u0026#39;color: purple;\\u0026#39; + \\u0026#39;background-color: #e5e5e5;\\u0026#39; + \\u0026#39;height: 150px;\\u0026#39; + \\u0026#39;}\\u0026#39;; // Get the first script tag var ref = document.querySelector(\\u0026#39;script\\u0026#39;); // Insert our new styles before the first script tag ref.parentNode.insertBefore(style, ref);  So, which approach should you use? I use a mix of both.\\nInline styles are useful when you need to set item-specific styles.\\nFor example, I have a script that normalizes the height of elements that are next to each other. I use style to set the height directly to each element.\\nIf a style applies to a class of elements, though? I\\u0026rsquo;ll inject a style tag for better performance and reusability.\\n\",\"summary\":\"Yesterday, we looked at how to get an element\\u0026rsquo;s CSS attributes with vanilla JavaScript.

If they click that or anywhere outside the modal, you want to close the modal.\\nOne way to handle this is with if...else statements.\\nvar closeModal = function () { document.querySelector(\\u0026#39;.modal\\u0026#39;).remove(); }; document.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;click\\u0026#39;, function (event) { if (event.target.matches(\\u0026#39;.modal-close\\u0026#39;)) { // If the clicked element is the .modal-close button, close the modal \\tcloseModal(); } else if (event.target.closest(\\u0026#39;.modal\\u0026#39;)) { // If the clicked element is the `.modal`, do nothing \\t} else { // Otherwise, close the modal \\tcloseModal(); } }, false);  Or, you could instead use return to end the function after the matching statement.\\nvar closeModal = function () { document.querySelector(\\u0026#39;.modal\\u0026#39;).remove(); }; document.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;click\\u0026#39;, function (event) { // If the clicked element is the .modal-close button \\tif (event.target.matches(\\u0026#39;.modal-close\\u0026#39;)) { // close the modal \\tcloseModal(); return; } // If the clicked element is the `.modal`, do nothing \\tif (event.target.closest(\\u0026#39;.modal\\u0026#39;)) return; // Otherwise, close the modal \\tcloseModal(); }, false);  Both approaches do the same thing, and the if...else statement probably save a byte or two when minified. But, I find the return approach easier to read, so that\\u0026rsquo;s what I use. Totally a personal preference thing.\\nYou can also use return for what I call a \\u0026ldquo;sanity check.\\u0026rdquo;\\nLet\\u0026rsquo;s say you have a function that depends on an argument or element to work. You can check for that item, and if it doesn\\u0026rsquo;t exist, return to end the function.\\nvar toggleMenu = function () { // Get the menu \\tvar menu = document.querySelector(\\u0026#39;#menu\\u0026#39;); // Sanity check \\tif (!menu) return; // Toggle the menu \\tmenu.classList.toggle(\\u0026#39;active\\u0026#39;); };  Without the sanity check, menu.classList would throw an error if no menu was found.\\n\",\"summary\":\"One of the discussions that came up in my private Vanilla JS Slack channel (available to people who purchase my pocket guides) the other day was when to use return in functions.\\nThere are two times you\\u0026rsquo;ll want to return in a function:\\n When you literally want to return a value.

Then, we return our extended object.\\nYou can pass in as many objects as you want. The method will automatically merge them all.\\nDeep Merging Our helper method currently does a shallow merge. Imagine you had two objects with a nested structure.\\nvar obj1 = { sandwich: \\u0026#39;chicken\\u0026#39;, condiment: \\u0026#39;mayo\\u0026#39;, desert: true, days: { monday: true, wednesday: true, friday: true } }; var obj2 = { sandwich: \\u0026#39;tuna\\u0026#39;, chips: \\u0026#39;Cape Cod\\u0026#39;, desert: false, days: { monday: false, tuesday: true, thursday: true } }  In a shallow merge, the days key in obj2 would completely overwrite the value from obj1. In a deep merge, the days objects from obj1 and obj2 would get merged together.\\n// Shallow merge { monday: false, tuesday: true, thursday: true } // Deep merge { monday: false, tuesday: true, wednesday: true, thursday: true, friday: true }  Depending on what you\\u0026rsquo;re trying to do, a shallow merge might be the desired result. Other times, you might want a deep merge.\\nLet\\u0026rsquo;s add the option to do both.\\nAdding a deep merge In jQuery\\u0026rsquo;s extend() method, you can pass in the first argument as a boolean. If it\\u0026rsquo;s true, it will do a deep merge instead of a shallow one. Let\\u0026rsquo;s use that same approach.\\nFirst, we\\u0026rsquo;re going to set up a new variable, deep, to store whether or not a merge should be deep. We\\u0026rsquo;ll set it to false by default. We\\u0026rsquo;re also going to predefine var i = 0 for our for loop.\\nvar extend = function () { // Variables \\tvar extended = {}; var deep = false; var i = 0; // ...  };  Then, we\\u0026rsquo;re going to check to see if the merge is deep.\\nIf it is, we\\u0026rsquo;ll set deep to true. We\\u0026rsquo;ll also advance our i variable by 1 so that our loop will start with the first object, and not the boolean indicating a deep merge.\\nvar extend = function () { // Variables \\tvar extended = {}; var deep = false; var i = 0; // Check if a deep merge \\tif (typeof (arguments[0]) === \\u0026#39;boolean]\\u0026#39;) { deep = arguments[0]; i++; } // ...  };  If it is a deep merge, whenever we encounter a property that\\u0026rsquo;s an object, we\\u0026rsquo;ll recursively send it back through our extend() method.\\nvar extend = function () { // Variables \\tvar extended = {}; var deep = false; var i = 0; // Check if a deep merge \\tif (typeof (arguments[0]) === \\u0026#39;boolean]\\u0026#39;) { deep = arguments[0]; i++; } // Merge the object into the extended object \\tvar merge = function (obj) { if (obj.hasOwnProperty(prop)) { if (deep \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; Object.prototype.toString.call(obj[prop]) === \\u0026#39;[object Object]\\u0026#39;) { // If we\\u0026#39;re doing a deep merge and the property is an object \\textended[prop] = extend(true, extended[prop], obj[prop]); } else { // Otherwise, do a regular merge \\textended[prop] = obj[prop]; } } }; // ...  };  Finally, we can remove the var i = 0 from our for loop, since we\\u0026rsquo;ve already set it. Here\\u0026rsquo;s the completed function.\\nvar extend = function () { // Variables \\tvar extended = {}; var deep = false; var i = 0; // Check if a deep merge \\tif (typeof (arguments[0]) === \\u0026#39;boolean]\\u0026#39;) { deep = arguments[0]; i++; } // Merge the object into the extended object \\tvar merge = function (obj) { if (obj.hasOwnProperty(prop)) { if (deep \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; Object.prototype.toString.call(obj[prop]) === \\u0026#39;[object Object]\\u0026#39;) { // If we\\u0026#39;re doing a deep merge and the property is an object \\textended[prop] = extend(true, extended[prop], obj[prop]); } else { // Otherwise, do a regular merge \\textended[prop] = obj[prop]; } } }; // Loop through each object and conduct a merge \\tfor (; i \\u0026lt; arguments.length; i++) { merge(arguments[i]); } return extended; };  You would use it like this:\\nvar shallowMerge = extend(obj1, obj2); var deepMerge = extend(true, obj1, obj2);  You can grab a copy of this function on GitHub.\\n\",\"summary\":\"Vanilla JavaScript doesn\\u0026rsquo;t offer any native method to merge objects together.\\n(Technically, you could use Object.assign(), but it has some limitations and doesn\\u0026rsquo;t support deep merging.)\\nToday, I\\u0026rsquo;m going to show you how to write a simple helper function for merging objects with vanilla JS.\\nThe Basic Approach To make this work, we want to create an empty object, and push the keys and properties of each of the objects we want to merge into it.\",\"title\":\"Merging objects with vanilla JavaScript\",\"url\":\"https://gomakethings.com/merging-objects-with-vanilla-javascript/\"},{\"categories\":[\"Code\",\"CSS\",\"JavaScript\",\"Technology\",\"WordPress\"],\"content\":\" A few weeks ago, I switched from Sublime Text to Visual Studio Code as my primary text editor.\\nI\\u0026rsquo;ve tried at various times in the past to switch to Atom from GitHub, but kept coming back to Sublime.

This is useful when doing things like creating lazy loading scripts.\\nGetting the bounding coordinates At the heart of our function is Element.getBoundingClientRect(), which provides an element\\u0026rsquo;s position within the viewport. It returns an object with an element\\u0026rsquo;s height and width, as well as it\\u0026rsquo;s distance from the top, bottom, left, and right of the viewport.\\n// Get the H1 heading var h1 = document.querySelector(\\u0026#39;h1\\u0026#39;); // Get it\\u0026#39;s position in the viewport var bounding = h1.getBoundingClientRect(); // Log the results console.log(bounding); // { // height: 118, // width: 591.359375, // top: 137, // bottom: 255, // left: 40.3125, // right: 631.671875 // }  Determining if the element is in the viewport If an element is in the viewport, it\\u0026rsquo;s position from the top and left will always be greater than or equal to 0. It\\u0026rsquo;s distance from the right will be less than or equal to the total width of the viewport, and it\\u0026rsquo;s distance from the bottom will be less than or equal to the height of the viewport.\\nThere are two ways to check the viewport\\u0026rsquo;s width. Some browsers support window.innerWidth, other\\u0026rsquo;s support document.documentElement.clientWidth, and some support both. We can try one and fallback to the other by doing something like this:\\n(window.innerWidth || document.documentElement.clientWidth)  Similarly, to get the viewport height, we can use window.innerHeight in some browsers and document.documentElement.clientHeight in others. Like with width, we can try one and fallback to the other:\\n(window.innerHeight || document.documentElement.clientHeight)  Putting it all together Let\\u0026rsquo;s use that heading from earlier as an example.\\n// Get the H1 heading var h1 = document.querySelector(\\u0026#39;h1\\u0026#39;); // Get it\\u0026#39;s position in the viewport var bounding = h1.getBoundingClientRect(); // Log the results console.log(bounding); // { // height: 118, // width: 591.359375, // top: 137, // bottom: 255, // left: 40.3125, // right: 631.671875 // }  We can check if the element is in the viewport like this.\\nif ( bounding.top \\u0026gt;= 0 \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; bounding.left \\u0026gt;= 0 \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; bounding.right \\u0026lt;= (window.innerWidth || document.documentElement.clientWidth) \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; bounding.bottom \\u0026lt;= (window.innerHeight || document.documentElement.clientHeight) ) { console.log(\\u0026#39;In the viewport!\\u0026#39;); } else { console.log(\\u0026#39;Not in the viewport... whomp whomp\\u0026#39;); }  That\\u0026rsquo;s super clunky to have to write out each time though, so this kind of thing deserves it\\u0026rsquo;s own helper function.\\nvar isInViewport = function (elem) { var bounding = elem.getBoundingClientRect(); return ( bounding.top \\u0026gt;= 0 \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; bounding.left \\u0026gt;= 0 \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; bounding.bottom \\u0026lt;= (window.innerHeight || document.documentElement.clientHeight) \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; bounding.right \\u0026lt;= (window.innerWidth || document.documentElement.clientWidth) ); };  We can pass in our element, and isInViewport() will get the bounding coordinates and run our check. It returns true if it\\u0026rsquo;s in the viewport, and false if it\\u0026rsquo;s not.\\nvar h1 = document.querySelector(\\u0026#39;h1\\u0026#39;); if (isInViewport(h1)) { // Do something... }  Using the helper method So how would you use it?\\nOne way I\\u0026rsquo;ve put this to use is in a lazy loading script.

So here\\u0026rsquo;s the deal\\u0026hellip;\\nNodeLists and Arrays are two different things because NodeLists are actually not a JavaScript API, but a browser API.\\nThings like querySelectorAll() and 1getElementsByTagName()` aren\\u0026rsquo;t JavaScript methods, they\\u0026rsquo;re browser APIs that let you access DOM elements. You can then manipulate them with JavaScript.\\nThis used to confuse me like crazy, too, because JavaScript is the scripting language of the front end. Turns out, other languages can access these methods, too.\\n(I actually didn\\u0026rsquo;t know this until you asked the question. Crazy, right?)\\nFor example, on MDN they provide an example of using Python and getElementsByTagName:\\n# Python DOM example import xml.dom.minidom as m doc = m.parse(\\u0026#34;C:\\\\\\\\Projects\\\\\\\\Py\\\\\\\\chap1.xml\\u0026#34;); doc.nodeName # DOM property of document object; p_list = doc.getElementsByTagName(\\u0026#34;para\\u0026#34;); NodeLists differ from Arrays in another meaningful way, too.\\nThey are often (but not always) live lists, meaning that if elements are removed or added to the DOM, the list updates automatically. querySelector() and querySelectorAll() return a static list (one that doesn\\u0026rsquo;t update), but properties like .childNodes are live lists that will change as you manipulate the DOM (which can be a good or bad thing, depending on how you\\u0026rsquo;re using it).\\nThis is all made more confusing because arrays can contain nodes. And, there\\u0026rsquo;s another, older type of list called an HTMLCollection that predates NodeLists, but is functionally similar (another article for another day).\\nThe key way to think about NodeLists vs. Arrays: NodeLists are a language-agnostic way to access DOM elements, and Arrays are a JavaScript object you can use to contain collections of stuff.\\nThey each have their own methods and properties, and you can convert a NodeList into an Array if you need to (but not the other way around).\\n\",\"summary\":\"Last week, we looked at two separate forEach() methods for Arrays and NodeLists.

This is what you get back when you use querySelectorAll().\\nEven though they look just like arrays, they\\u0026rsquo;re not, so you can\\u0026rsquo;t use array-specific methods on them (which is absurd and confusing).\\nThe Old Way The traditional way of looping through NodeLists is the same as looping through arrays: with a for loop.\",\"title\":\"Looping through NodeLists with ES6\",\"url\":\"https://gomakethings.com/looping-through-nodelists-with-es6/\"},{\"categories\":[\"Code\",\"JavaScript\"],\"content\":\" The traditional way of looping through arrays in vanilla JavaScript is with a for loop:\\nvar sandwiches = [ \\u0026#39;tuna\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;ham\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;turkey\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;pb\\u0026amp;j\\u0026#39; ]; for (var i = 0; i \\u0026lt; sandwiches.length; i++) { console.log(i); // index \\tconsole.log(sandwiches[i]); // value } // returns 0, tuna, 1, ham, 2, turkey, 3, pb\\u0026amp;j   In the first part of the loop, before the first semicolon, we set a counter variable (typically i, but it can be anything) to 0. The second part, between the two semicolons, is the test we check against after each iteration of the loop. In this case, we want to make sure the counter value is less than the total number of items in our array. We do this by checking the .length of our array. Finally, after the second semicolon, we specify what to run after each loop. In this case, we\\u0026rsquo;re adding 1 to the value of i with i++.  We can then use i to grab the current item in the loop from our array.\\nIt works, but it\\u0026rsquo;s kind of a pain to work with. If you you use loops often, I generally recommended using something like Todd Motto\\u0026rsquo;s forEach.js helper method.\\nES6 offers a simple, native solution Just like jQuery, we now have a native forEach() method.\\nvar sandwiches = [ \\u0026#39;tuna\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;ham\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;turkey\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;pb\\u0026amp;j\\u0026#39; ]; sandwiches.forEach(function (sandwich, index) { console.log(index); // index \\tconsole.log(sandwich); // value });  This works back to IE9, and if you need further backwards compatibility, there\\u0026rsquo;s also a polyfill available.

Here it is:\\n Eminem. I\\u0026rsquo;m not a huge fan of his music, but he is one of the most brilliant lyricists of all time. His ability to rhyme difficult words, construct complex rhyming patterns, and freestyle are unrivaled. Andre 3000. I wish he had a solo album, but he\\u0026rsquo;s complex and deeply lyrical while occupying a sub-genre of hip-hop that\\u0026rsquo;s generally known for its more simplistic lyrics. His opening verse of \\u0026ldquo;Da Art of Storytelling Part 4\\u0026rdquo; is one of my favorite rap verses of all time. Lil Wayne. Lean is seriously ruining his career, but this guy is a machine. He\\u0026rsquo;s been doing this for a long time, and between his official releases, features, and mix-tapes, he churns out an absurd amount of music each year. The way he writes songs\\u0026mdash;on the fly\\u0026mdash;is amazing to watch, and he launched the careers of two other hip-hop superstars: Drake and Nicki. Tupac brought depth and substance to a genre that was largely one-dimensional. He was nuanced. He was vulnerable. He was a contradiction. He was a poet. Kanye. I haven\\u0026rsquo;t liked any of his music since Graduation, but he\\u0026rsquo;s left a huge mark on the hip-hop culture. He\\u0026rsquo;s helped spawn two new sub-genres, first with his chip-and-dale style oldies samples, and then again with his bass-driven 808\\u0026rsquo;s style. As a producer, he catapulted Jay-Z\\u0026rsquo;s already great career. He made it ok to be preppy and rap (before later ruining hip-hop fashion).  Into hip-hop?

On each loop, we\\u0026rsquo;ll grab the element\\u0026rsquo;s .parentNode and see if it has our selector. If it doesn\\u0026rsquo;t, we\\u0026rsquo;ll jump to the next .parentNode and repeat.\\nFirst, let\\u0026rsquo;s setup a helper function.\\nvar getClosest = function () { // Code goes here... };  Next, let\\u0026rsquo;s create our loop.\\nvar getClosest = function (elem) { for ( ; elem \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; elem !== document; elem = elem.parentNode ) { // Do something... \\t} };  Normally, you\\u0026rsquo;d set a variable in the first part of your for loop (something like var i = 0), but we don\\u0026rsquo;t need any for this loop.\\nThe next part (between the two semicolons) is where we evaluate our criteria for continuing the loop. We want to make sure that an elem exists and that it\\u0026rsquo;s not the document element (which means we\\u0026rsquo;ve reached the top of the page with no results).\\nFinally, the last part (after the second semicolon) is where we tell the loop what to do after each iteration. We want to set the elem variable to the current element\\u0026rsquo;s parent (this is how we climb up the DOM).\\nMatching by selector Inside our loop, we want to check and see if the current element matches our selector. For a class we might use classList. For an ID we\\u0026rsquo;d use elem.id === 'our-id'. And so on. To make things easy, though, let\\u0026rsquo;s use the .matches() method, which checks any valid CSS selector.\\nvar getClosest = function (elem, selector) { for ( ; elem \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; elem !== document; elem = elem.parentNode ) { if ( elem.matches( selector ) ) return elem; } return null; };  If there\\u0026rsquo;s a matching element, our helper function will return it. If it makes it through the whole loop without a match, it returns null.\\nBrowser compatibility There\\u0026rsquo;s one last thing we need to do, though. Many browsers implemented .matches() with proprietary prefixes. Others didn\\u0026rsquo;t implement it but support querySelectorAll. In both cases, a lightweight polyfill bolts in .matches() support.\\nvar getClosest = function (elem, selector) { // Element.matches() polyfill \\tif (!Element.prototype.matches) { Element.prototype.matches = Element.prototype.matchesSelector || Element.prototype.mozMatchesSelector || Element.prototype.msMatchesSelector || Element.prototype.oMatchesSelector || Element.prototype.webkitMatchesSelector || function(s) { var matches = (this.document || this.ownerDocument).querySelectorAll(s), i = matches.length; while (--i \\u0026gt;= 0 \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; matches.item(i) !== this) {} return i \\u0026gt; -1; }; } // Get the closest matching element \\tfor ( ; elem \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; elem !== document; elem = elem.parentNode ) { if ( elem.matches( selector ) ) return elem; } return null; };  This gives you browser support back to at least IE9.\\nPutting it all together Now you can do something like this:\\ndocument.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;click\\u0026#39;, function (event) { // If the clicked item is an `.accordion-toggle` get the parent `.accordion` \\tif ( event.target.classList.contains(\\u0026#39;accordion-toggle\\u0026#39;) ) { // Get the parent with the `.accordion` class \\tvar parent = getClosest(event.target, \\u0026#39;.accordion\\u0026#39;); } }, false);  Now that you know how this works, you could modify it to things like:\\n Get all matching parents (not just the first). Get all parent elements and push them to an array. Get all parent elements until you find one that matches a selector. And more!

There are a ton of form validation scripts. There\\u0026rsquo;s even a bunch of vanilla JS ones.\\nMost of them require you to manually specify your validation criteria with JavaScript\\u0026mdash;individually naming each field and how it should be validated. That\\u0026rsquo;s a pain in the ass.\\nValidate.js hooks into the browser-native form input types (like email, number, and url) and validation attributes (like required, pattern, and max and min). All you need to do is include it on your site and run validate.init(). The script handles the rest.\\n\\u0026lt;div\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;label for=\\u0026#34;email\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;Email\\u0026lt;/label\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;input type=\\u0026#34;email\\u0026#34; id=\\u0026#34;email\\u0026#34; required\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;div\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;label for=\\u0026#34;url\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;URL\\u0026lt;/label\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;input type=\\u0026#34;url\\u0026#34; id=\\u0026#34;url\\u0026#34; required\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt; Instead of the native pop-up errors on submit, Validate.js displays an error (if there is one) as soon as the user leaves each field. It also checks all fields on submit and brings the first one with an error into focus.\\nWant to submit successful forms via Ajax? Validate.js has you covered. You can disable page reload on submit and pass in whatever callback function you want instead.\\nValidate.js also lets you customize all of the error messages (you can also just use the defaults) and style them however you want.\\nWhat about browser support? Out-of-the-box, it works in all modern browsers, and (mostly) IE 10 and above.\\nUnfortunately, not all validation types are supported by all versions of IE and Edge consistently. For example, IE10 and IE11 will check if a form input is too long (using the maxLength attribute), but Edge will not. And no version of IE or Edge will check if it\\u0026rsquo;s too short (using the minLength attribute).\\nThe script comes with a polyfill that pushes support back to IE10 (and adds missing features to partially supporting browsers). And if you include Eli Grey\\u0026rsquo;s classList.js polyfill, you can push support back to IE9.\\nGrab Validate.js on GitHub.\\n\",\"summary\":\"This week I released Validate.js, a lightweight, open source form validation script.\\nYou can play with the demo here.\\nHow is Validate.js different?

Find the content that goes with the link. If it\\u0026rsquo;s closed open it. If it\\u0026rsquo;s opened, close it.  Then, I googled how to do each part of that. I tossed it up on GitHub. I picked another project and repeated the process. I eventually started adding features, more learning. I started emailing authors of JS articles I liked, or bugging them on Twitter, with questions. Eventually, Todd Motto and I started talking regularly. At the time, he was all about vanilla JavaScript. Todd started ripping apart my work. I learned a ton. People started issues pull requests for my projects to add features or fix stupid bugs. More learning.  That brings me to today. There\\u0026rsquo;s still so much I don\\u0026rsquo;t know. ES6 arrow functions still confuse the hell out of me. I suck at prototypal coding (I prefer what\\u0026rsquo;s called functional programming). And on and on.\\nThe thing that had the biggest impact on my career, though, was open sourcing all of my pet projects. They started small, grew over time, and getting feedback, questions, and feature requests pushed me to learn even more.

Josh Clark from Big Medium writes:\\n Only 2 out of every 1000 mobile web users ever tap a custom share button—like even once—according to a Moovweb study. We found similarly tiny numbers during our research designing Philly.com and verticals for About.com. That means people are over 11 times more likely to tap a mobile advertisement than a mobile share button for Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc.\\nTo be clear: people do share a ton of webpages to those services from mobile devices, but it happens through other means—using browsers’ built-in sharing tools or copying the URL directly into a social post. Mobile users have established their own sharing habits, in other words, and for the vast majority, those habits don’t involve share buttons embedded in the page canvas.\\n There\\u0026rsquo;s a caveat, though.  Turns out that use of custom share buttons leaps way, way, way up for visitors coming directly from a social network. People are 20 times more likely to use a social button on mobile when they’ve tapped through from a social network, we discovered during our research designing the About.com verticals. Call them the “20x users.”\\n So here\\u0026rsquo;s what you should do about it:  By default, don\\u0026rsquo;t display social sharing buttons. BUT, if someone visits your site from Facebook, show the Facebook sharing button. If they visit from Twitter, show the Twitter sharing button. I\\u0026rsquo;d recommend using the static HTML versions instead of the ones the social networks give you. Josh recommends setting a cookie and making them persistent across the visit.

Based on instrumentation in Chrome, we've learned that pages featuring third-party scripts inserted via document.write() are typically twice as slow to load than other pages on 2G. We collected data from a 28 day field trial on 1% of Chrome stable users, restricted to users on 2G connections. We saw that 7.6% of all page loads on 2G included at least one cross-site, parser-blocking script that was inserted via document.write() in the top level document. As a result of blocking the load of these scripts, we saw the following improvements on those loads:  10% more page loads reaching first contentful paint (a visual confirmation for the user that the page is effectively loading), 25% more page loads reaching the fully parsed state, and 10% fewer reloads suggesting a decrease in user frustration. 21% decrease of the mean time (over one second faster) until the first contentful paint 38% reduction to the mean time it takes to parse a page, representing an improvement of nearly six seconds, dramatically reducing the time it takes to display what matters to the user.   10 seconds of extra delay on an already slow connection!

Want to add some custom fields to your custom post type?\\nWith WordPress\\u0026rsquo;s metabox functionality, you can! There are a few moving parts here, so let\\u0026rsquo;s walk through them one-by-one.\\nQuick aside: I\\u0026rsquo;m going to share some PHP snippets. Place them in a plugin, or (less ideally) your functions.php file.\\nCreate your metabox This has two parts:\\n A function that sets up the metabox, giving it a name and telling WordPress which content types to load it on (posts, pages, some custom post type, etc.). A function that generates the actual markup for the metabox.  Setting up the metabox We can use the add_meta_box() function to create new metaboxes. We need to hook into WordPress\\u0026rsquo;s add_meta_boxes action hook.\\nIn add_meta_box(), you\\u0026rsquo;ll give your metabox an ID, a name, a function to use to generate the markup, a post type to display it on (posts, pages, etc.), and a location and priority on the page.\\nThe post type can only be a single value (not an array), so if you want to use your metabox on multiple post types, you\\u0026rsquo;ll need to repeat the add_meta_box() function a couple of times.\\n/** * Create the metabox * @link https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_meta_box/ */ function _namespace_create_metabox() { // Can only be used on a single post type (ie. page or post or a custom post type). // Must be repeated for each post type you want the metabox to appear on. add_meta_box( \\u0026#39;_namespace_metabox\\u0026#39;, // Metabox ID \\u0026#39;Some Metabox\\u0026#39;, // Title to display \\u0026#39;_namespace_render_metabox\\u0026#39;, // Function to call that contains the metabox content \\u0026#39;post\\u0026#39;, // Post type to display metabox on \\u0026#39;normal\\u0026#39;, // Where to put it (normal = main colum, side = sidebar, etc.) \\u0026#39;default\\u0026#39; // Priority relative to other metaboxes ); // To add the metabox to a page, too, you\\u0026#39;d repeat it, changing the location add_meta_box( \\u0026#39;_namespace_metabox\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;Some Metabox\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;_namespace_render_metabox\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;page\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;normal\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;default\\u0026#39; // Priority relative to other metaboxes ); } add_action( \\u0026#39;add_meta_boxes\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;_namespace_create_metabox\\u0026#39; ); Rendering the metabox markup Now we need to create content for the function specified in add_meta_box().\\nWe\\u0026rsquo;ll want to grab the $post, and get our saved field value (if one exists). We also need to include a security field that we\\u0026rsquo;ll check against to make sure this is a valid submission from the WordPress Dashboard.\\nYou\\u0026rsquo;ll note that our field data is wrapped in an esc_attr() function.

If it does, we validate that field using the wp_verify_nonce() function. We also check that the submitting user has permission to edit the post.\\nFinally, we make sure that our field was submitted with data.

And if Google’s plans with Android One are any indication, then we have a fairly good idea of what kind of devices the “next billion” will be using:\\n They’ll mostly be running Android. They’ll have decent specs (1GB RAM, quad-core processors). They’ll have an evergreen browser and WebView (Android 5+). What they won’t have, however, is a reliable internet connection.  In a world where your lowest common denominator is a very capable browser with a modern JavaScript engine, running on a smartphone that would have been classified as desktop-class ten years ago, but the network is now the bottleneck, what does that mean for progressive enhancement?\\nSimple: it means that, if you care about those users, you should be focusing on offline-first, i.e. treating the network as an enhancement. After the first load (which yes, should be server-rendered via isomorphic JavaScript), you’ll want to run as much logic as possible on the user’s device so that it can operate autonomously – regardless of whether the network conditions are good, bad, or nonexistent. And today, the way we accomplish this on the web is by using IndexedDB and Service Workers, i.e. with JavaScript.\\n Nolan quite effectively argues that, today, progressive enhancement does not mean the core functionality of a site works without JavaScript, but rather works without an internet connection.\\nHis take on this issue really got me thinking about whether or not I\\u0026rsquo;m clinging to now outdated notions of what it means to build a web that works for everyone. A few thoughts, most of them mentioned by others far more articulately than I\\u0026rsquo;m about to in the comments of Nolan\\u0026rsquo;s post or in rebuttal articles\\u0026hellip;\\n I don\\u0026rsquo;t see this as an either/or proposition. I think you can build sites and apps that fulfill the core mission without JavaScript, or with server-side JavaScript, and ALSO provide an enhanced experience that\\u0026rsquo;s JavaScript dependent and works offline. I don\\u0026rsquo;t think it\\u0026rsquo;s fair to assume the next billion users will all be using state-of-the-art Android devices. Many current mobile-only users aren\\u0026rsquo;t using such devices, and many Android users are left in the dark with outdated software on relatively new phones. Offline or spotty connection access is really important, which is why I think a JavaScript-dependent experience is dangerous. It\\u0026rsquo;s the most fragile layer of the stack. When CSS fails because of a bad connection, the content still renders. With that content requires JavaScript? Not so much.  So ultimately, Nolan raises some really good points about what PE looks like going forward, but I don\\u0026rsquo;t see it as mutually exclusive with how we\\u0026rsquo;ve thought about progressive enhancement up to this point.\\nGo read the whole thing, and check out some of the rebuttals he links to as well as the comments.\\n\",\"summary\":\"Nolan Lawson wrote an interesting perspective on progressive enhancement the other week:\\n As Benedict Evans has noted, the next billion people who are poised to come online will be using the internet almost exclusively through smartphones.

If I can\\u0026rsquo;t copy-and-paste them into your form, they\\u0026rsquo;re useless.\\nDisabling paste on password forms forces me to create something easier to type and less secure.\\nAnd it doesn\\u0026rsquo;t actually improve security, which I\\u0026rsquo;m assuming was your goal.\\nYour password recovery questions suck You know those security questions you get asked if you lose your password and need to recover it?\\nWhat was your mother\\u0026rsquo;s maiden name? What was your high school mascot? What was your first car?\\nYea, that\\u0026rsquo;s all really easy information to find out. Ask better, more esoteric questions (if you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be?). Or better yet, let me create my own questions.\\nGet real two-factor authentication A static pin or asking me to confirm that a picture of a grassy meadow is in-fact the picture I selected don\\u0026rsquo;t improve security in a meaningful way.\\nProvide real two-factor authentication via a text message or an app like Google Authenticator.\\nYou can do better It\\u0026rsquo;s absurd that my Facebook and Twitter accounts have better security than your financial website does.\\n\",\"summary\":\"I\\u0026rsquo;m continually amazed at how bad web security practices are on financial and healthcare websites.\\nYes, they\\u0026rsquo;re generally encrypted.

By ditching cable in favor internet-only TV viewing, I save about $1,000 a year. As a side-benefit, I can also watch my content on any device (TV, laptop, tablet, smartphone) from anywhere.\\nIn this article, I detail everything I\\u0026rsquo;ve learned from two years of being a cord cutter.\\nReally good internet When you ditch cable, you of course stream all of your content over the web.\\nHaving really good internet is incredibly important. Otherwise, everything will run really slow and be super frustrating.\\nIf you can, go with Verizon FiOS. Their 50/50mbps plan is perfect. They\\u0026rsquo;ll try to upsell you to something faster, but you don\\u0026rsquo;t need it as long as you have a good router (more on that in the hardware section).\\nComcast, Cox Communications, and Charter all offer internet-only plans at similar speeds. For physics reasons, fiber-optic gives you superior, consistent internet speeds in a way that traditional coaxial internet cannot, but FiOS isn\\u0026rsquo;t an option everywhere.\\nAfter an initial first-year discount, most vendors will increase you price, and it can start climb. If you have competition, call them up and tell them you\\u0026rsquo;re going to cancel because of cost. Be firm, and they\\u0026rsquo;ll almost always offer you a discount.\\nServices How do you actually watch shows without cable? There are a variety of web-based services you can use to watch shows and movies, depending on what you like.\\nHere are the services I use (and a few that I don\\u0026rsquo;t but that are highly recommended)\\u0026hellip;\\nHulu Hulu is where I watch most of my current-run TV shows from the major networks. They also have some newer movies and great original programming.\\nThey don\\u0026rsquo;t have everything\\u0026mdash;notably missing is CBS\\u0026mdash;as negotiating with networks is tricky, but this is my first stop when I\\u0026rsquo;m ready to watch something.\\nThey start at $7 a month ad supported, but the ad-free plan at $12 a month is so worth it.\\nAmazon Video For shows that aren\\u0026rsquo;t available on Hulu, I purchase season passes on Amazon Video for about $25 a show.\\nIf you\\u0026rsquo;re a Prime member, though, Amazon offers an asburd amount of free shows and movies, and some really, really great original programming.\\nPrime membership is $11 a month, but if you buy the year up front for $99, it\\u0026rsquo;s only $8.25 a month. It\\u0026rsquo;s also gets you free 2-day shipping on all your Amazon orders. Totally worth it!\\nHBO Now Previously, you could only get HBO through a cable-provider. Today, you can get HBO as a standalone web service directly with HBO Now for just $15 a month.\\nHBO has a bunch of movies and some fantastic shows. This one is definitely a splurge, but I\\u0026rsquo;ve gotten hooked.\\nYouTube In addition to funny cat videos, YouTube has an incredible amount of high-quality original content.\\nI\\u0026rsquo;m a geek, so I watch a lot of science and history channels. But you can find great shows on politics, sports, cars, travel, and more. 100% free, with some light ads every now and then.\\nNetflix Anytime I\\u0026rsquo;ve looked into Netflix, I\\u0026rsquo;ve found their catalog is mostly focused on older runs of shows and movies. As a result, I don\\u0026rsquo;t subscribe.\\nBut\\u0026hellip; they\\u0026rsquo;ve focused a lot on original programming lately, and most of my friends love their content. HD plans start at $10 a month.\\nSling If you watch a lot of sports, or like non-network cable channels like AMC, TBS, History, or USA, Sling is the service for you.\\nA contract-free web streaming service from Dish Network, Sling offers small bundles for shows you can get from other services. Most notable are ESPN, HGTV, and the Food Network. I don\\u0026rsquo;t use Sling, but if I was more into sports, I would.\\nA bit on the steep side, their basic plan is $20 a month.\\nPlex This one is more for geeks who don\\u0026rsquo;t mind maintaining their own hardware. Plex is a media server that lets you share photos, music, and movies with other devices on (and, if you want, off) of your network.\\nThis means you can keep digital movies you own on a single device and stream them to all of your other devices.\\nOver-the-Air Antennas have come a long way from the rabbit ears of the past. I use a digital antenna to get about 25 HD channels, including all of the major networks, PBS, and a few local channels focused on old reruns and movies.\\nIf you\\u0026rsquo;re into sports but don\\u0026rsquo;t need to watch every game from every team, this is a great, free option. I can watch games from all of my local teams (even the away games).\\nIt\\u0026rsquo;s also great for watching CBS, which isn\\u0026rsquo;t available on Hulu and whose CBS All-Access standalone service is overloaded with ads. I also use it to watch special events like the Macy\\u0026rsquo;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, the Superbowl, and the ball-drop on New Year\\u0026rsquo;s Eve.\\nI\\u0026rsquo;ll talk about the tech for this in the hardware section.\\nHardware So you\\u0026rsquo;ve chosen your services. Now, how do you access everything? Let\\u0026rsquo;s talk hardware.\\nRoku Roku is a tiny little box with a simple remote control that turns your dumb TV into a smart one.\\nYou can install apps for all of the streaming services listed above and more. I recommend the Roku 3 (unless you\\u0026rsquo;re into 4k TV, in which case you\\u0026rsquo;ll want the Roku 4).\\nI also have a Roku Streaming Stick for when I travel. The tradeoff for the small form factor is that it\\u0026rsquo;s really underpowered and slow, so I don\\u0026rsquo;t recommend it for daily use.\\nRoku\\u0026rsquo;s can be hardwired with an ethernet cable, but they can also run on your wifi network, which means you can place them wherever you have a TV.\\nWhy not Apple TV? I own a lot of Apple products, and I often get asked why I don\\u0026rsquo;t use an Apple TV. Apple TV still doesn\\u0026rsquo;t have a native Amazon Video app, and I watch a lot of Amazon video content. If I rented most of my stuff from iTunes instead, I might feel differently.\\nIt\\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that you can watch Amazon Video by airplaying it from an iPhone or iPad, but that\\u0026rsquo;s a pain in the ass.\\nA Digital Antenna This is how you capture over-the-air TV.\\nThe rabbit ears are gone. Today\\u0026rsquo;s antenna\\u0026rsquo;s look like mud flaps and can be mounted inside the house.\\nI use the Mohu Leaf 50, because I live out in the boonies and it has a great range. You can find them for a lot cheaper on Amazon than on their website.\\nI mounted mine in the peak of my attic. It just tacks into a stud with a nail.\\nTablo Tablo is an amazing device and service that adds a DVR, TV guide, and streaming service to your digital antenna.\\nWire the coaxial cable from your antenna directly into your tablo, and add your own USB hard drive. Tablo connects to your wifi network, and lets you stream your antenna to any of your devices, including your roku, tablets, smart phones, and laptop.\\nYou can record your favorite shows, and pause and rewind live over-the-air TV. For a small monthly fee (or a larger lifetime subscription), Tablo will also add a TV guide feature so you can easily find stuff to watch and record by show title rather than by date and time.\\nYou can also setup Tablo for off-network access, so you can stream your favorite shows from anywhere.\\nA Media Server If you use Plex, you need somewhere to store and stream your media files.\\nIf you\\u0026rsquo;ve got a desktop computer at home, you can just run it on that and keep your computer on all the time (that\\u0026rsquo;s the cheapest option). You can also run Plex off a Western Digital MyCloud Mirror (not the smaller, cheaper MyCloud, which won\\u0026rsquo;t load apps).\\nA Better Router The router your internet provider gives you is probably terrible.\\nI\\u0026rsquo;d recommend upgrading to one of Negear\\u0026rsquo;s AC routers. Something in the AC1200 to AC1750 range should work well.\\nIf you\\u0026rsquo;re on FiOS, you have to use their router, because it converts their fiber-optic signal into something that can go through coaxial lines. But, if you\\u0026rsquo;re tech savvy and not too afraid of breaking things, you can put it into bridge mode (effectively turning off wifi on it and using it like a router) and connect it to a personal, better router.\\nMy house is a bit large, so I also added a NetGear range extender.\\n\",\"summary\":\"Two years ago, I decided to ditch cable.\\nMy cable bill had grown from around $70 a month as part of an initial promotional offer to almost $200, with no change in service.

MailChimp for EDD extends it, giving you the ability to add people who buy a product or use a discount code to a list, and segment them into groups within that list.\\nA better empty cart The default empty cart message is a bit lame. The free Easy Digital Downloads - Empty Cart plugin lets you customize it.\\nRemoving the name fields I don\\u0026rsquo;t need someone\\u0026rsquo;s name when they buy one of my books. I only need their email address, and wanted to keep the checkout process as frictionless as possible.\\nI used the following code in my functions.php file to remove the name fields:\\n/** * Unset first and last name as required fields in checkout * @param Array $required_fields Required fields */ function keel_edd_purchase_form_required_fields( $required_fields ) { unset( $required_fields[\\u0026#39;edd_first\\u0026#39;] ); unset( $required_fields[\\u0026#39;edd_last\\u0026#39;] ); return $required_fields; } add_filter( \\u0026#39;edd_purchase_form_required_fields\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;keel_edd_purchase_form_required_fields\\u0026#39; ); /** * Remove default name fields from checkout */ function keel_edd_remove_names() { remove_action( \\u0026#39;edd_purchase_form_after_user_info\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;edd_user_info_fields\\u0026#39; ); } add_action( \\u0026#39;init\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;keel_edd_remove_names\\u0026#39; ); /** * Override the checkout fields markup without the name fields */ function keel_edd_user_info_fields() { if( is_user_logged_in() ) : $user_data = get_userdata( get_current_user_id() ); endif; ?\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;fieldset id=\\u0026#34;edd_checkout_user_info\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;?php do_action( \\u0026#39;edd_purchase_form_before_email\\u0026#39; ); ?\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;p id=\\u0026#34;edd-email-wrap\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;label class=\\u0026#34;edd-label\\u0026#34; for=\\u0026#34;edd-email\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;strong\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;?php _e(\\u0026#39;Email Address\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;edd\\u0026#39;); ?\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/strong\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/label\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;input class=\\u0026#34;edd-input required\\u0026#34; type=\\u0026#34;email\\u0026#34; name=\\u0026#34;edd_email\\u0026#34; placeholder=\\u0026#34;\\u0026lt;?php _e(\\u0026#39;Email address\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;edd\\u0026#39;); ?\\u0026gt;\\u0026#34; id=\\u0026#34;edd-email\\u0026#34; value=\\u0026#34;\\u0026lt;?php echo is_user_logged_in() ? $user_data-\\u0026gt;user_email : \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;; ?\\u0026gt;\\u0026#34;/\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;?php do_action( \\u0026#39;edd_purchase_form_after_email\\u0026#39; ); ?\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;?php do_action( \\u0026#39;edd_purchase_form_user_info\\u0026#39; ); ?\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;/fieldset\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;?php } add_action( \\u0026#39;edd_purchase_form_after_user_info\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;keel_edd_user_info_fields\\u0026#39; );  Only allow a single item on checkout Because I\\u0026rsquo;m not running a proper store, I don\\u0026rsquo;t want to have a \\u0026ldquo;View Cart\\u0026rdquo; link in my navigation. I want someone to click on the \\u0026ldquo;Buy Now\\u0026rdquo; button and go right to the checkout. Choosing another item removes the first one.\\n(Admittedly, this made more sense when I sold just one book with three different packages.)\\nHere\\u0026rsquo;s the PHP I added to my functions.php file to make that happen:\\n/** * Only allow a single item at checkout */ function keel_edd_force_single_item_cart() { edd_empty_cart(); return edd_get_cart_contents(); } add_filter( \\u0026#39;edd_add_to_cart\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;keel_edd_force_single_item_cart\\u0026#39;, 1, 1 ); Display \\u0026ldquo;JavaScript Required\\u0026rdquo; message on checkout if JS is disabled Both PayPal and Stripe require JavaScript to work. To make this more obvious, I wanted to disable the checkout button and add an error message if it\\u0026rsquo;s disabled.\\nFirst, I added this PHP to my functions.php file.

If I won\\u0026rsquo;t or don\\u0026rsquo;t want to implement a feature you care about, that\\u0026rsquo;s my right.\\nGitHub makes it really easy to fork and modify any public project.

I spend a lot of time writing documentation.\\nAs a new developer, I was always frustrated by bad or nonexistent documentation on open source projects. Before I was able to really read code and understand how it worked, it made using other people\\u0026rsquo;s stuff really difficult.\\nAs a result, I spend a lot of time writing documentation that can used by people of all skill levels.\\nDespite this, I\\u0026rsquo;ll often get asked questions that are addressed directly in the documentation. If you\\u0026rsquo;re a beginner and something\\u0026rsquo;s unclear, I\\u0026rsquo;m more than happy to help you understand it better.\\nBut please read the documentation before you ask me how to do something.\\nLook at existing issues before opening a new one. GitHub issues are searchable. If you have a question or think you\\u0026rsquo;ve found a bug, search for it to make sure it hasn\\u0026rsquo;t been asked already before submitting a new issue.\\nIf the issue already exists and there\\u0026rsquo;s nothing in it that solves your problem, add to the existing discussion.\\nProvide as much info as possible when reporting a bug.

No additional information.\\nThe absolute best thing you can do is provide a reduced test case. Remove all other plugins, styles, and so on until you get the most reduced version of your site that still triggers the issue.\\nThis makes it far easier for me to identify the problem, but might also help you figure it out yourself.\\nKnowing what browser, operating system, and version of my code you\\u0026rsquo;re using or have been able to replicate the problem in helps, too.\\nIf there are contributing guidelines, follow them. Seriously.\\nIf you\\u0026rsquo;re submitting a Pull Request to contribute code to my project, follow the contributing guidelines.

Opening a tab or accordion updates the URL with a hash: http://someurl.com#some-content. Opening a tab or accordion should bring that content into focus. Visitors can right-click or command/control-click to open the link in a new window. If someone visits the page and the hash matches the ID of the tab or accordion, they\\u0026rsquo;re jumped to that section on the page and the content is already open and visible. The forward and back buttons on the browser should allow you to navigate back and forth, opening tabs or accordions. If someone is reading the page with a screen reader, they shouldn\\u0026rsquo;t even notice that it\\u0026rsquo;s tabbed. It should work just like anchor links, with all of the content accessible and readable to the screen reader without having to click a link. Focusing on a link or input inside a tab or accordion should open it (for sighted keyboard users). If JavaScript fails to load or breaks for some reason, the visitor is left with\\u0026hellip; perfectly functional anchor links!  The code 1. It starts with good markup. Start with simple anchor links and content sections with IDs. It\\u0026rsquo;s also helpful to add some classes or data attributes for styling and targeting.\\n\\u0026lt;ul\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;li\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;a class=\\u0026#34;tab-toggle\\u0026#34; href=\\u0026#34;#tab1\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;Tab 1\\u0026lt;/li\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;li\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;a class=\\u0026#34;tab-toggle\\u0026#34; href=\\u0026#34;#tab2\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;Tab 2\\u0026lt;/li\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;li\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;a class=\\u0026#34;tab-toggle\\u0026#34; href=\\u0026#34;#tab3\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;Tab 3\\u0026lt;/li\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;/ul\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;div class=\\u0026#34;tabs\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;div class=\\u0026#34;tab-pane\\u0026#34; id=\\u0026#34;tab1\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt; ... \\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;div class=\\u0026#34;tab-pane\\u0026#34; id=\\u0026#34;tab2\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt; ... \\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;div class=\\u0026#34;tab-pane\\u0026#34; id=\\u0026#34;tab3\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt; ... \\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt; 2. Let the browser do most of the heavy lifting. You can use JavaScript to prevent the default click event, update URLs, and intercept the forward and back buttons to open content.\\nBut it\\u0026rsquo;s so much easier and less fragile to just let the browser handle that with anchor links. It does it already, and it does a great job.\\nInstead of using event.preventDefault() to stop the normal click behavior, I just let the link be a link. This would normally result in the page jumping to the anchor location, which isn\\u0026rsquo;t really desirable for tabs and accordions, though.\\nTo get around this problem, I use JavaScript to remove the anchored content\\u0026rsquo;s id, store it as a data attribute, and then add it back after the URL updates.\\n// Listen for click events document.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;click\\u0026#39;, function (event) { // Only take action if the clicked link was a tab toggle with a valid anchor link \\tif ( !event.target.classList.contains( \\u0026#39;tab-toggle\\u0026#39; ) || !event.target.hash ) return; // Get the anchored content \\tvar content = document.querySelector( event.target.hash ) if ( !content ) return; // Store the ID as a data attribute and remove it \\tcontent.setAttribute( \\u0026#39;data-id\\u0026#39;, content.id ); content.id = \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;; }, false);  After the URL update, add the ID back and open the content.\\n// Listen for hashchange events window.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;hashchange\\u0026#39;, function (event) { // Get the anchored content \\tvar content = document.querySelector( \\u0026#39;[data-id=\\u0026#34;\\u0026#39; + window.location.hash.substring(1) + \\u0026#39;\\u0026#34;]\\u0026#39; ); if ( !content ) return; // Restore the ID \\tcontent.id = content.getAttribute( \\u0026#39;data-id\\u0026#39; ); // Open the content, close other tabs, whatever \\tcontent.classList.add( \\u0026#39;active\\u0026#39; ); }, false);  This approach also means that you can open a tab or accordion based on the hash.\\n// Get the content var content = document.querySelector( window.location.hash ); // If the content is a tab, open it if ( content \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; content.classList.contains( \\u0026#39;tab-pane\\u0026#39; ) ) { content.classList.add( \\u0026#39;active\\u0026#39; ); // close other tabs or do whatever else here }  And as a bonus, clicking the forward and back buttons on the browser will now automatically jump you between tabs or accordions, automatically opening them for you.\\n3. Only hide content visually. Historically, I would do something like this to show and hide my tabs and accordion content:\\n/* Hide the tab */ .tab-pane { display: none; visibility: hidden; } /* Show the tab when active */ .tab-pane.active { display: block; visibility: visible; } Using this approach makes the content completely invisible to screen readers unless it has the .active class.\\nI now use a different approach to only hides the content visually. Screen readers can still see and read it, even if it\\u0026rsquo;s not visible to sighted users.\\n/* Hide the tab */ .tab-pane { border: 0; clip: rect(0 0 0 0); height: 1px; margin: -1px; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; position: absolute; width: 1px; } /* Show the tab when active */ .tab-pane.active { clip: auto; height: auto; margin: 0; overflow: visible; position: static; width: auto; } Doing this means not having to mess around with aria roles or adding information for screen readers about which tabs are open, which are closed, etc. As far as the screen reader is concerned, these are just valid anchor links.\\n4. Set focus. Normally, when you click an anchor link, focus on the page jumps to the anchored section.\\nSince we\\u0026rsquo;re removing the ID before the URL updates and then adding it back, this never happens. Fortunately, it\\u0026rsquo;s really easy to do this with JavaScript.\\nOne caveat: you need to add tabindex=\\u0026quot;-1\\u0026quot; to the content if it\\u0026rsquo;s not already a focusable content type.\\nGoing back to our previous hashchange listener:\\n// Listen for hashchange events window.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;hashchange\\u0026#39;, function (event) { // Get the anchored content \\tvar content = document.querySelector( \\u0026#39;[data-id=\\u0026#34;\\u0026#39; + window.location.hash.substring(1) + \\u0026#39;\\u0026#34;]\\u0026#39; ); if ( !content ) return; // Restore the ID \\tcontent.id = content.getAttribute( \\u0026#39;data-id\\u0026#39; ); // Open the content, close other tabs, whatever \\tcontent.classList.add( \\u0026#39;active\\u0026#39; ); // Try to bring the content into focus \\tcontent.focus(); // If it didn\\u0026#39;t work, give the content a tabindex of -1 and try again \\tif ( document.activeElement.id !== content.id ) { content.setAttribute( \\u0026#39;tabindex\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;-1\\u0026#39; ); content.focus(); } }, false);  This results in a blue outline around the content. You can easily remove this with a touch of CSS.\\n.tab-pane:focus { outline: none; } 5. Open the content if a link or input field inside it is focused. This is for the benefit of sighted users who navigate with a keyboard\\u0026mdash;people with neuromuscular disorders like Parkinson\\u0026rsquo;s, for example.\\nSince the content is only visually hidden, then can tab their way through all of the focusable areas. If they tab into an element that\\u0026rsquo;s visually hidden, that can be really confusing.\\nFortunately, we can detect focus, check if the focused element is inside a tab or accordion, and open it up if it is.\\n// A helper function to find a parent element with the matching class // @link https://gomakethings.com/ditching-jquery/#climb-up-the-dom var getClosest = function ( elem, selector ) { ... } // Listen for focus events // Last argument must be \\u0026#34;true\\u0026#34; for this to work document.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;focus\\u0026#39;, function (event) { // Only take action if the focused content is in a tab \\tvar content = getClosest( event.target, \\u0026#39;.tab-pane\\u0026#39; ); if ( !content ) return; // Open up the tab, but DON\\u0026#39;T change focus, since we want it to stay on the focused content \\tcontent.classList.add( \\u0026#39;active\\u0026#39; ); // close other tabs or do whatever else here  }, true);  6. Only hide content if JavaScript loads. Remember, we\\u0026rsquo;re treating this as an enhancement. By default, your tabs or accordion should just be anchor links. When your JavaScript file loads, add a class to the \\u0026lt;html\\u0026gt; element.\\n// Add the .tabs-loaded class to the \\u0026lt;html\\u0026gt; element document.documentElement.classList.add( \\u0026#39;tabs-loaded\\u0026#39; );  Next, hook into that class in your CSS before hiding any content.\\n/* Hide the tab */ .tabs-loaded .tab-pane { border: 0; clip: rect(0 0 0 0); height: 1px; margin: -1px; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; position: absolute; width: 1px; } /* Show the tab when active */ .tabs-loaded .tab-pane.active { clip: auto; height: auto; margin: 0; overflow: visible; position: static; width: auto; } Seeing it in action To see these techniques in action, check out Tabby or Houdini.\\nAs extendable plugins, these are both a bit more robust than the simple examples I showed here. But feel free to try them out, dig through the code, and ask me any questions.\\n\",\"summary\":\"This week I refactored two of my open source projects\\u0026mdash;a toggle tabs plugin and an accordions plugin\\u0026mdash;to make them more accessible to people who access the sites I build with screen readers or navigate primarily with a keyboard.\\nToday, I wanted to talk about my changing approach to writing JavaScript plugins that show and hide content on a web page.\\nThe approach I\\u0026rsquo;ve started thinking of tabs and accordions as visually enhanced anchor links rather than new functionality:\",\"title\":\"Accessible toggle tabs and accordions\",\"url\":\"https://gomakethings.com/accessible-toggle-tabs-and-accordions/\"},{\"categories\":[\"Accessibility\",\"Code\",\"Design and UX\",\"JavaScript\"],\"content\":\"I just pushed a major accessibility update to my Modals plugin.\\nIn previous versions, when a modal opened, focus would remain on the button or link you clicked to open the window.

Let\\u0026rsquo;s look at each of them in a bit more detail.\\n1. It needs to work on every device. This one sounds relatively obvious today, when responsive web design is a given for most projects.\\nHowever\\u0026hellip; as the \\u0026ldquo;JavaScript for all the things\\u0026rdquo; crowd marches forward, this principle gains a lot of nuance.\\nIt\\u0026rsquo;s not just building sites that work for every new, cutting edge smart device. It\\u0026rsquo;s all devices.\\nIt\\u0026rsquo;s that old Windows XP machine with IE8. It\\u0026rsquo;s that old Blackberry you still use because, hell, it works. It\\u0026rsquo;s some smart but underpowered new web device that hasn\\u0026rsquo;t hit the market yet.\\nBuilding websites that work on every devices\\u0026mdash;even the old, underpowered, unsexy ones\\u0026mdash;ensures that your sites will have far more longevity for new devices that haven\\u0026rsquo;t been created yet.\\nWhat does this mean in practice? In a phrase: progressive enhancement.\\nIt means that if JavaScript isn\\u0026rsquo;t available, or if your JS file fails to load or has an error, the visitor can still do the things they came to do. Adding items to a cart or checking out and making a purchase still work.\\nAll the content is still visible and usable. Ugly, perhaps. Less interactive. But usable.\\nThis is just good design. A more fault-tolerant website is a more successful one.\\n2. It needs to work for everyone. On the surface, this sounds the same as principle #1.\\nBut a site that works on every device is a bit different than one that works for everyone. The latter is built with users of all capabilities in mind.\\nLinks are sufficiently large and well spaced that people with fat thumbs (like me) or neuromuscular disorders can still tap them. The font is large enough that people with bad eyes (again, like me) can read it.\\nThe site can be easily navigated by keyboard or screenreader. Critical images have alt text for the visually impaired. Active links have visual indicators for keyboard-only users. Links in general are distinguishable from the text, even for people with colorblindness.\\nThe web was built for everyone. The sites we build need to honor that.\\n3. It needs to be insanely fast. This is, in some ways, a sub-principle of #2.\\nNot everyone accesses the web from a fast device or a fast internet connection.\\nSome people live in areas where high-speed internet is nonexistent. Others use their mobile device exclusively, with all of the spotty coverage and hardware issues that come with it. Some people are just on an older computer that runs slow.\\nA website that\\u0026rsquo;s too slow is a website that\\u0026rsquo;s unusable for a significant number of people.\\nHow fast do I think a website should be? Around 1 second to start displaying content on a cable connection, 3 seconds on 3g, and 5 seconds on an EDGE network.\\nIt\\u0026rsquo;s absolutely achievable, even on inexpensive shared hosting and a \\u0026ldquo;bloated,\\u0026rdquo; open source CMS. I do it all the time.\\nThe common thread The common thread among all three of my principles for building for the web: the web is for everyone.\\nBuilding a website that works on any device, for any user, allows you to reach more people and, for businesses, realize more profit.\\nThese are idealistic goals, for sure.

Some topics were based on my previous experience coaching developers on careers. Others were based on emails I\\u0026rsquo;d gotten from readers of my newsletter.\\nI didn\\u0026rsquo;t worry too much about structure and order at this point. I just wanted to capture all of the things I needed to write about.\\nWriting the book I cheated, and you should, too.\\nI pulled about a third of the book content from previous articles I\\u0026rsquo;ve written, email responses I sent to newsletter readers, and so on. I did some light editing on those, but why reinvent the wheel? This is the same approach I used for Wicked Fast Websites.\\nFor all of the stuff left to be written, I opened up my text editor (I like Sublime Text) and just started writing in markdown.\\nPicking a topic I knew well and was ready to write about helped a lot. There was minimal research involved. I just put everything taht was already in my head down into pixels.\\nOrganizing the book After getting everything out into markdown, I started to organize stuff into a logical order.\\nWhat would someone need to know first before this other piece of info makes sense? How would they approach a task? What would they need to do first? Let\\u0026rsquo;s talk about that first.\\nI reordered my markdown files just by renaming them with a numbered prefix: 01, 02, etc.\\nEditing the book I edited the book myself, which can be tough. Your brain tends to ignore typos or incorrect words because it knows what you meant to write and doesn\\u0026rsquo;t even notice when it says something different.\\nTo get around this, I created a Kindle version of the book from my markdown files (more on this later) and sent it to myself by email.\\nReading the book on a different device in a different medium forced me to notice all sorts of things I\\u0026rsquo;d messed up. I used the Kindle notes feature to collect of my changes. When I was done reading the whole thing, I pulled up my list of notes and made all of my updates.\\nCreating the book I used Pandoc to create PDF and EPUB versions of the book from my markdown files, and Calibre to convert it to Kindle\\u0026rsquo;s MOBI format.\\nBoth of these are 100% free, but do require you to be comfortable working in command line.\\nSetting Pandoc up to look the way I wanted took a bunch of trial and error. To make things easier for you (and me next time I do this), I open sourced my ebook boilerplate.\\nSetting book info Pandoc uses a metadata.yml file to set the title, subtitle, author name, and so on, and embeds all of that into the EPUB. It also autogenerates a title page for you.\\nPDFs don\\u0026rsquo;t use this file, so I also created a title.md file that contains all of that stuff. I only include it with the PDF version.\\nCreating a cover I created a simple cover in Keynote (in the past, I\\u0026rsquo;ve used PowerPoint). I set up my Keynote to have a custom 1100 x 850 pixel size, so that it would generate files I could scale to 8.5 x 11, the size of my PDF.\\nI exported the cover to PNG file, which I link to in the metadata.yml file for EPUB and MOBI formats.\\nPandoc can\\u0026rsquo;t create a full-bleed cover image. You have two options:\\n Just include the image in the title.md file and be ok with white margins. Create a standalone PDF and merge it with the ebook.  I chose option 2. Easy to do on OSX in Preview (just drag and drop thumbnails), and there are free tools to do this in Windows as well.\\nNote: I create some \\u0026ldquo;good enough\\u0026rdquo; covers for this project, but you want want to hire someone to create a professional cover for you.\\nDistributing the book I decided to use Easy Digital Downloads to sell the book directly through my site.\\nI had toyed with using something like SendOwl or GumRoad, but ultimately decided I wanted more control and flexibility over things.\\nEasy Digital Downloads is awesome and super extensible if you\\u0026rsquo;re comfortable working with PHP and WordPress. I\\u0026rsquo;ll be covering all of my integrations and customizations for this in another article.\\nMarketing the book This is always the biggest struggle for me.\\nI sent out a few emails to my newsletter telling them about the book before it launched, and then again after. Since they\\u0026rsquo;re the awesomest people on the planet, I gave them some serious money off: 50% for everyone, and 100% off for people who wanted to be book evangelists (both good for just 48 hours).\\nI also mentioned the book on Twitter a few times, and am now reaching out to some podcasts to talk about careers for web developers.\\nThree articles you should definitely read on this:\\n Marketing tools for any self-published book $26,679 in 24 hours: stats from my latest book launch What I learned selling $6,000+ of my ebook today  It\\u0026rsquo;s worth mentioning that my numbers are nowhere near that impressive.

In the median case the blank text time was ~350 ms, ~750 ms for the 75th percentile, and a scary ~2300 ms for the 95th.\\n Even the median value of 350ms is an unacceptable performance hit. Fortunately, there\\u0026rsquo;s a simple fix.\\nA better way A better approach is to have a system font load immediately, and then when your web font is available, switch over to that. It results in a repaint, but your content is immediately available to visitors.\\nTo achieve this, we\\u0026rsquo;re going to load the font asynchronously with loadCSS.js.\\nHowever, just loading asynchronously isn\\u0026rsquo;t enough. You\\u0026rsquo;ll still get a FOIT doing that\\u0026mdash;it will just happen a second or three later.\\nWe also need a way to detect when the font is fully loaded. Fortunately, Font Face Observer from Bram Stein does just that!\\nWe\\u0026rsquo;ll load the font asynchronously, and use Font Face Observer to detect when it\\u0026rsquo;s loaded. When it loads, we\\u0026rsquo;ll add a class to the \\u0026lt;html\\u0026gt; element that we can hook into for styling.\\nbody { font-family: Georgia, serif; } .fonts-loaded body { font-family: \\u0026#39;PT Serif\\u0026#39;, serif; } How to do this in WordPress Traditionally, you would load your web font using the wp_enqueue_style function:\\n// Load theme fonts function load_theme_fonts() { wp_enqueue_style( \\u0026#39;theme-fonts\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans\\u0026#39;, null, null, \\u0026#39;all\\u0026#39; ); } add_action(\\u0026#39;wp_enqueue_scripts\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;load_theme_fonts\\u0026#39;); Instead, we want to hook into the wp_head action to inline loadCSS:\\n// Load fonts inline in the header function load_fonts_inline_header() { ?\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;script\\u0026gt; // Inline our JS files \\tfunction loadCSS(){ ... }; // Also inline all of the contents from fontfaceobserver.js  // Async load the CSS file \\tloadCSS(\\u0026#39;//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=PT+Serif:400,400italic,700,700italic\\u0026#39;); // When the font loads, as the .fonts-loaded class to the \\u0026lt;html\\u0026gt; element \\tvar font = new FontFaceObserver(\\u0026#39;PT Serif\\u0026#39;); font.load().then(function () { document.documentElement.className += \\u0026#39; fonts-loaded\\u0026#39;; }); \\u0026lt;/script\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;?php } add_action(\\u0026#39;wp_head\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;load_fonts_inline_header\\u0026#39;, 30);  This is technically not the \\u0026ldquo;WordPress Way\\u0026rdquo; of doing things. The Codex stress using wp_enqueue_style so that stylesheets are registered and accessible to plugins and other functions. But I think the performance benefits far outweigh the cost of deviating from the best practice here.\\nWhat about browser caching?

You can use a skip link to jump users to that navigation.\\n\\u0026lt;a class=\\u0026#34;screen-reader screen-reader-focusable\\u0026#34; href=\\u0026#34;#secondary-nav\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;Skip to Course Navigation\\u0026lt;/a\\u0026gt; Some other content... \\u0026lt;nav class=\\u0026#34;tabindex\\u0026#34; id=\\u0026#34;secondary-nav\\u0026#34; tabindex=\\u0026#34;-1\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;Nav content...\\u0026lt;/nav\\u0026gt; Focus visibility One of the biggest accessibility issues I see on websites is the removal of :focus styling from links.\\nWhen you tab onto a link, it should be outlined in blue. This let\\u0026rsquo;s sighted keyboard users easily determine which link is in focus.\\nIf there\\u0026rsquo;s anything in your stylesheet (other than our .tabindex class) that\\u0026rsquo;s removing border on :focus, remove it right now.\\nSkipping over links There may be times where you have links that you don\\u0026rsquo;t want to show up as a user tabs through content.\\nThis article, for example, has a link with a # symbol after each header. This gives you easy access to an anchor link you can use to jump people to a particular section.\\nImagine having to skip over those as you move through every article on a site though? It would get old and annoying pretty quickly.\\nAdding tabindex=\\u0026quot;-1\\u0026quot; to a link removes it from the normal tab order, so it gets skipped as visitors tab through your content.\\nAsk for feedback Adrienne Debigare pointed me to this awesome little trick on LinkedIn\\u0026rsquo;s site: include a hidden keyboard user link asking for a11y feedback.\\nI added one to my site. It just requires our skip link classes and a mailto value:\\n\\u0026lt;a class=\\u0026#34;screen-reader screen-reader-focusable\\u0026#34; href=\\u0026#34;mailto:your@email.com\\u0026amp;subject=Accessibility%20Feedback\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;Accessibility Feedback\\u0026lt;/a\\u0026gt; What I love about this one is that it empowers your audience to tell you when you\\u0026rsquo;re doing it wrong. I don\\u0026rsquo;t use my keyboard to navigate around websites. I\\u0026rsquo;m not always aware of the unique challenges keyboard-only users face, or things that work poorly on a particular visitors setup.\\nThis gives those users an easy way to reach you and tell you what\\u0026rsquo;s wrong so that you can fix it.\\nWhat now? This article barely scratched the surface of web accessibility, but hopefully it\\u0026rsquo;s caused you to start thinking about the way you build websites a bit differently.\\nIf nothing else, go implement these easy fixes today!\\n\",\"summary\":\"Web accessibility (or a11y, for short) is a speciality area that you could spend a lifetime mastering.\\nToday, though, I wanted to share with you a few simple things you can do to make your site more usable for visually impaired and keyboard-only users who visit your site.\\n\\n\",\"title\":\"Hidden content for better a11y\",\"url\":\"https://gomakethings.com/hidden-content-for-better-a11y/\"},{\"categories\":[\"Code\",\"CSS\"],\"content\":\"As I get older, my disdain for small typography grows.\\n(It\\u0026rsquo;s not just me.

To make it easier I:\\n Setup a local copy of my site, running on MAMP. Pulled down all of my plugins and media files into the local site using FTP. My local site matched my live site exactly. Used WP Sync Database to automatically copy all of my site data to the local site. Single click, and it even switches URLs over so nothing breaks. Setup new site on DigitalOcean. Used WP Sync Database again to push from my local site to the new live site.  I probably had about 2 hours of downtime while waiting for DNS records to update and moving content over.\\nWhat I don\\u0026rsquo;t like about DigitalOcean You\\u0026rsquo;re on your own for installing things like phpMyAdmin, which you need to do via command line (though, honestly, I haven\\u0026rsquo;t needed it once since I switched).\\nAlso, every now and then the server gets hung up on a process and I need to restart it (maybe once every month or two). Takes about 2 minutes, but if you\\u0026rsquo;re used to a \\u0026ldquo;everything just works\\u0026rdquo; kind of environment, slightly annoying.\\nAll that said, it\\u0026rsquo;s cheaper than what I was paying before, and so blazingly, insanely fast.

These devices range from the very capable (the latest Apple and Android phones and tablets) to the very old and underpowered (a Nintendo DS and my 5 year old Kindle).\\nWhich of these devices does PAWS New England support? All of them.\\nBuilding in layers Think of your website as a house. The foundation and frame of your website are made out of HTML (short for \\u0026ldquo;hypertext markup language\\u0026rdquo;). This is all of the text (and stuff that gets wrapped around it) that shows up on your site.\\nCSS (short for \\u0026ldquo;cascading style sheet\\u0026rdquo;) is a bit like paint and decor. It controls how the HTML looks: what color it is, where it\\u0026rsquo;s placed on the page, and so on. If the CSS failed to download, the HTML would still be there, ugly but readable.\\nJavaScript is a bit like electricity. It adds interactivity to your site, and powers things like expand-and-collapse menus, image carousels, and so on. And much like electricity, it can stop working very easily. An error or bug in one file can cause all of the other, properly functioning JavaScript to stop working, too.\\n(Kind of like how an issue down the street will shut off electricity in your house, but has no impact on your foundation or home decor.)\\nOk, my website is house. So what? The problem is, sometimes web developers use JavaScript to create HTML (your content). When the JavaScript breaks, the content never loads. (Imagine if a power outage caused a wall in your house to disappear. Madness, right?)\\nRemember, like electricity, JavaScript is fragile. A single bug in the code could break the whole thing. Or the file may be taking too long to load, so your visitor\\u0026rsquo;s mobile device just stops downloading it (this is common on slow internet connections). Or maybe they\\u0026rsquo;re at work, and their employer blocks JavaScript files out of security concerns (common at bigger corporations).\\nRemember the \\u0026ldquo;Add to Cart\\u0026rdquo; button that does nothing? You don\\u0026rsquo;t want your site to stop functioning\\u0026mdash;even though it may visually look fine\\u0026mdash;just because one file isn\\u0026rsquo;t working properly.\\nHow do I know if I have this problem? Testing this is a bit harder than some of the other topics we\\u0026rsquo;ve covered so far, but it can be done pretty easily if you\\u0026rsquo;re comfortable adjusting your web browser settings. (If not, just reply to this email and I\\u0026rsquo;ll take a look for you.)\\n Turn off JavaScript in your browser. Here are instructions on how to do that. Visit your website. Resize your browser window so it\\u0026rsquo;s small, like a mobile device. Make sure everything that\\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be there is visible and works.  Some things to look for: images and buttons in carousels, drop-down menus, lists of adoptable animals, and donation buttons.\\nIf your site breaks with JavaScript turned off, there may be some easy fixes.\\n\",\"summary\":\"Have you ever been shopping on your phone, and when you click the “Add to Cart” or “Buy Now” button, nothing happens?

Here\\u0026rsquo;s what he had to say.\\n\\nThe Interview with SOSARL Chris (from Go Make Things): What made you decide to focus on web performance for SOSARL?\\nMike (from SOSARL): I had e-mailed you in October of 2014 to thank you, as your design for PAWS New England had very much inspired the design of SOSARL\\u0026rsquo;s site.\\nThe problem with my design was that sure, I had designed it to look all slick but it had absolutely no optimization\\u0026mdash;a point you raised to me in our e-mail exchange. I knew that the site seemed to load a little slow sometimes, but I hadn\\u0026rsquo;t done a test in quite some time.\\nSeeing the load times that you had gotten when you analyzed the site was eye-opening and a reminder that I though I had built a good-looking site, it won\\u0026rsquo;t mean a thing if users are giving up when the page isn\\u0026rsquo;t loading fast enough. So, I took some of the great advice that you had given me and I was able to cut down the load time in half, and then some.\\nChris: Where there any key metrics or targets you looked at? Did you have a target goal for the finished optimizations?\\nMike: I didn\\u0026rsquo;t have a specific target in mind, I just knew that I needed to bring the \\u0026ldquo;Time to First Byte\\u0026rdquo; and the \\u0026ldquo;Start Render\\u0026rdquo; time way down. Originally they were 2.330s and 3.562s, respectively - contributing to a total load time of 18.684s.\\nWhen I saw that number, I couldn\\u0026rsquo;t believe it, my jaw almost went through the floor. Imagine waiting almost 20 seconds for a site that you want to visit to fully render\\u0026mdash;it was completely unacceptable.\\nChris: What steps did you take to the improve your site performance?\\nMike: First I went for the easy stuff. I got rid of a few parallax effects and slide/fade-in animations that I had given to some images. They were \\u0026ldquo;nice-to-have,\\u0026rdquo; but honestly completely unnecessary as far as the average user for our site goes.\\nI also identified several images that were taking way too long to load because they were ridiculously large and uncompressed\\u0026mdash;something I had been a bit careless about. I scaled and compressed the images that needed it, and in some cases completely ditched the original image and went with something else altogether.\\nAfter that, I saw that there was a JS-based widget that we were loading in the footer which showed a random adoptable dog\\u0026rsquo;s name/picture as a \\u0026ldquo;Featured Dog\\u0026rdquo;. This was taking almost 12 seconds to load! I decided to get rid of that widget on all pages site-wide. It was not used much at all, and it was all the way down in the footer area, which is unlikely to be seen by the casual user.\\nThose were the heaviest hitters by themselves, but I still decided there was more to be done, so I installed Quick Cache (now ZenCache) since we\\u0026rsquo;re on the WordPress platform. I enabled server-side and client-side caching, which made a huge difference\\u0026mdash;almost an unbelievable amount of difference in load times.\\nAfter installing ZenCache Pro (we sprung for the Pro option, more on that soon), I saw that it detected we weren\\u0026rsquo;t leveraging gZIP compression, so I modified our .htaccess file and voila! I was seeing an 80% reduction in file size.\\nZenCache Pro also minifies HTML/CSS for me, so I enabled that and saw even faster load times.\\nFinally, I researched some ways to defer the loading of javascript or load it asynchronously, since a ton of it was done in the \\u0026lt;head\\u0026gt; section. I installed a plugin to handle that, and once I did that my load time decreased by at least another 20%.\\nChris: Of the changes you made, what had the biggest impact on your performance?\\nMike: Installing ZenCache Pro, by far. The combination of the minifying/combining of the CSS files, as well as the client/server-side caching was huge.\\nChris: Which of your optimizations was the hardest to implement?\\nMike: So, confession time: I\\u0026rsquo;m not a web designer/developer by trade, I\\u0026rsquo;m an IT guy\\u0026mdash;a virtualization engineer to be specific. When it comes to building websites, I know my way around for sure, and I know what the average user is looking for, but I\\u0026rsquo;m relatively novice as far as coding goes. I\\u0026rsquo;m learning for sure, this whole experience has taught me so much, but I\\u0026rsquo;m by no means an expert.\\nWith that out of the way\\u0026hellip; we\\u0026rsquo;re using a Wordpress.org platform for sosarl.org, so I simply installed ZenCache Pro and WP Deferred Javascripts, made the appropriate tweaks and made sure I didn\\u0026rsquo;t break the website or the javascript-based toolkit which loaded our list of adoptable dogs.\\nThere were other parts which were trial-and-error, but I\\u0026rsquo;d hardly say that was difficult to implement. I suppose if we replaced the word \\u0026ldquo;hardest\\u0026rdquo; with \\u0026ldquo;most time-consuming,\\u0026rdquo; it would be getting the images to be optimized while maintaining a high level of quality. That was a lot of time for me as I ended up ditching a whole bunch of images that didn\\u0026rsquo;t look great, so I ended up having to create all new images using GIMP. For instance, for some of the homepage sliders, there would be a large background image and a smaller foreground image on the slide. To create a nice effect, I\\u0026rsquo;d adjust the color saturation and darken the background image, and apply a slight-to-moderate blurring filter. The foreground image would be the original, unaltered image.\\nEventually I ditched the slider foreground image and just went with a large, high-quality (but properly compressed) slider background image with a darkened box behind the slider text, and this saved not only load time, but the overall size of the page.\\nAll told, I brought the site\\u0026rsquo;s size down from a whopping, hefty 9 MB to 1.9 MB. Still a bit high, but that\\u0026rsquo;s more than 4-fold improvement!\\nI should also mention that I\\u0026rsquo;m using a DB optimizer too (the WP-Optimize plugin) which runs automatically every week to keep our database size in check.

The classList.js polyfill extends classList support back to IE8 (natively, it\\u0026rsquo;s IE10+). Buoy is a tiny collection of helper methods taht I use in most of my scripts.\\nUMD Wrapper I use a Universal Module Definition (UMD) wrapper for all of my plugins. This wrapper means that my scripts are compatibile with both AMD and CommonJS, and also work as a traditional module pattern.\\nIt also creates scope around the plugin, preventing variables and functions from being added to the global scope or being overridden by similarly named variables in other scripts.\\n(function (root, factory) { if ( typeof define === \\u0026#39;function\\u0026#39; \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; define.amd ) { define([\\u0026#39;buoy\\u0026#39;], factory(root)); } else if ( typeof exports === \\u0026#39;object\\u0026#39; ) { module.exports = factory(require(\\u0026#39;buoy\\u0026#39;)); } else { root.myPlugin = factory(root, root.buoy); } })(typeof global !== \\u0026#39;undefined\\u0026#39; ? global : this.window || this.global, function (root) { // Plugin stuff...  });  This sets up the namespacing for your plugin. You should change myPlugin to the name of your plugin.\\nAny references to buoy pass in my helper library as a dependency. In a browser, root is the window. This line addresses a Browserify bug that doesn\\u0026rsquo;t pass in root as window like it\\u0026rsquo;s supposed to.\\ntypeof global !== \\u0026#39;undefined\\u0026#39; ? global : this.window  use strict use strict tells the browser (and JS linting tools) to be more strict about the errors that they throw. This sounds like a bad thing, but if forces you to write better, more cross-compatibile code. Always use it.\\nVariables At the top of my plugin, I setup the variables I\\u0026rsquo;m going to be using throughout. This keeps everything neatly organized and in one place, and makes it easier to access variables without having to specifically pass them in to methods later.\\n// // Variables //  var myPlugin = {}; // Object for public APIs var supports = !!document.querySelector \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; !!root.addEventListener; // Feature test var settings; // Placeholder variables  // Default settings var defaults = { someVar: 123, initClass: \\u0026#39;js-myplugin\\u0026#39;, callbackBefore: function () {}, callbackAfter: function () {} };  myPlugin should be changed to the name of your plugin. Any public methods (ones that can be accessed and used outside of the module wrapper) are added to this object, which is returned at the end of the script. No variables or functions can be accessed or used outside of your plugin unless they\\u0026rsquo;re explicitly added to the myPlugin object.\\nFor example, myPlugin.init() will be used to initialize the plugin, and is accessible from other scripts, where as the supports variable cannot be.\\nEvent Handler I pass any event listeners-clicks, scrolls, window resizing-through my eventHandler method.\\n/** * Handle events * @private */ var eventHandler = function (event) { // @todo Do something on event };  You can put all sorts of login in here. For example, I like to put my click event listeners on the document element, and then check to see if the element that was clicked is one of the ones I care about.\\nvar eventHandler = function (event) { var toggle = buoy.getClosest(event.target, \\u0026#39;[data-example]\\u0026#39;); if ( toggle ) { // Prevent default click event \\tif ( toggle.tagName.toLowerCase() === \\u0026#39;a\\u0026#39;) { event.preventDefault(); } // Run your methods \\tmyPlugin.someMethod(); } };  If you want can pass all event types into a single handler, and use some logic to determine the course of action based on the event type.\\nvar eventHandler = function (event) { if ( event.type === \\u0026#39;scroll\\u0026#39; ) { myPlugin.scrollMethod(); } if ( event.type === \\u0026#39;click\\u0026#39; ) { myPlugin.clickMethod(); } };  Destroy Method I like to provide a way to destroy the current initialization of a plugin. This is useful if you need to reinitialize for some reason, or if another script simply needs to halt whatever you\\u0026rsquo;ve got going. As always, change myPlugin to the name of your plugin.\\n/** * Destroy the current initialization. * @public */ myPlugin.destroy = function () { // If plugin isn\\u0026#39;t already initialized, stop \\tif ( !settings ) return; // Remove init class for conditional CSS \\tdocument.documentElement.classList.remove( settings.initClass ); // @todo Undo any other init functions...  // Remove event listeners \\tdocument.removeEventListener(\\u0026#39;click\\u0026#39;, eventHandler, false); // Reset variables \\tsettings = null; };  Initialize While I sometimes write scripts that run on page load, I generally prefer a deliberate initialization. This allows developers to pass in their own settings that can override plugin defaults. It also lets developers include the script on every page as part of a concatenate file without actually running it on every page.\\n/** * Initialize Plugin * @public * @param {Object} options User settings */ myPlugin.init = function ( options ) { // feature test \\tif ( !supports ) return; // Destroy any existing initializations \\tmyPlugin.destroy(); // Merge user options with defaults \\tsettings = buoy.extend( defaults, options || {} ); // Add class to HTML element to activate conditional CSS \\tdocument.documentElement.classList.add( settings.initClass ); // @todo Do stuff...  // Listen for click events \\tdocument.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;click\\u0026#39;, eventHandler, false); };  First, I run a check to make sure the required web and JavaScript APIs are supported. In my case, document.querySelector and window.addEventListener are the big ones. These are defined in the supports variable at the beginning of the script.\\nif ( !supports ) return;  Then, I destroy any existing initializations of the script to avoid conflicts or duplicate event listeners.\\nmyPlugin.destroy();  Next, I merge any user settings with the defaults using the extend method in Buoy.\\nsettings = buoy.extend( defaults, options || {} );  A user would pass settings in like so:\\nmyPlugin.init({ someVar: 456, initClass: \\u0026#39;js-changeme\\u0026#39;, })  I\\u0026rsquo;m a huge advocate of progressive enhancement, and I wait until my JavaScript plugin is initialized before using CSS to hide any content. As a result, I add a class to the html element that I can hook onto with my CSS after the script initializes.\\ndocument.documentElement.classList.add( settings.initClass );  Lastly, I create my event listeners.\\ndocument.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;click\\u0026#39;, eventHandler, false);  Any methods that should run as soon as the plugin initializes should also be called in myPlugin.init().\\nReturn your public methods The last thing in my plugins is a return with the myPlugin object. This let\\u0026rsquo;s developers run any of the public methods in the plugin by prefixing them with myPlugin..\\nreturn myPlugin;  An example Let\\u0026rsquo;s look at a simple example to see how this all works together.\\nI want to create a plugin called clickMe.js that adds a class to a link when the link is clicked.

Well, you can!\\nLet\\u0026rsquo;s look at a few different ways to do that.\\n\\nBackground Images You can load viewport-aware background images using media queries. You can even use different images based on screen density.\\n.background-img { background-image: url(\\u0026#34;/path/to/the/image-small.jpg\\u0026#34;); } @media (min-width: 30em) { .background-img { background-image: url(\\u0026#34;/path/to/the/image-medium.jpg\\u0026#34;); } } @media (min-width: 40em) { .background-img { background-image: url(\\u0026#34;/path/to/the/image-large.jpg\\u0026#34;); } } @media (min-width: 60em) { .background-img { background-image: url(\\u0026#34;/path/to/the/image-xlarge.jpg\\u0026#34;); } } Most browsers will only load the image required for the current viewport size. If a visitor resizes their browser or rotates their device, and this triggers a new break point, a subsequent image download will occur, but the benefits of using smaller sizes outweight the edge case of a potential second download.\\nOf course, you\\u0026rsquo;re not always going to use a background image, which brings use to\\u0026hellip;\\nThe \\u0026lt;picture\\u0026gt; element and srcset Being able to specify which version of an image to show at which breakpoint sounds great. And in many cases, it is (think art direction across a variety of viewports).\\nBut it also involves a lot of math and decision making on your part that really should be offloaded to the browser. Rather than figuring which image to send and when, imagine if you could just tell a browser the sizes it has to choose from and let it figure out which image works. This opens up the door for some interesting opportunities:\\n Browsers could automatically figure out which image would look best given the device\\u0026rsquo;s screen resolution. Visitors could choose to prioritize performance over aesthetics, forgoing, for example, the high-resolution images when in low bandwidth conditions or if trying to conserve data. Browsers could determine that grabbing the highest required resolution for an image and downsizing on orientation change makes more sense than a second download (or vice-versa).  Today, you as the developer are making decisions that really belong in the hands of the visitor and their browser. Fortunately, a pair of solutions are in the works.\\nThe \\u0026lt;picture\\u0026gt; element The \\u0026lt;picture\\u0026gt; element let\\u0026rsquo;s you serve different images based on breakpoints:\\n\\u0026lt;picture\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;source srcset=\\u0026#34;path/to/image-xlarge.jpg\\u0026#34; media=\\u0026#34;(min-width: 60em)\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;source srcset=\\u0026#34;path/to/image-large.jpg\\u0026#34; media=\\u0026#34;(min-width: 40em)\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;img srcset=\\u0026#34;path/to/image-standard.jpg\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;/picture\\u0026gt; The srcset attribute The srcset attribute allows you to provide a few image choices, and share some information with the browser that helps it decide which image to choose. It can be used with a standard \\u0026lt;img\\u0026gt; element, or with the \\u0026lt;picture\\u0026gt; element.\\n\\u0026lt;img src=\\u0026#34;path/to/image-small.jpg\\u0026#34; srcset=\\u0026#34;path/to/image-large.jpg 1024w, path/to/image-medium.jpg 640w, path/to/image-small.jpg 320w\\u0026#34; sizes=\\u0026#34;(min-width: 36em) 33.3vw, 100vw\\u0026#34; \\u0026gt; Browser Support Currently, support for srcset isn\\u0026rsquo;t great, and support for the \\u0026lt;picture\\u0026gt; element is even worse, but support will get better in the near future.\\nHowever, the Picturefill polyfill from Filament Group let\\u0026rsquo;s you use both methods today.

Fonts at this size are difficult to read on small and high resolution screens.\\nFor body copy, you should aim for 16px at a minimum. This is actually the default base font size in most browsers. It will seem too big at first if you\\u0026rsquo;re not use to building sites that way, but after a few weeks, anything smaller will seem absurd, and your visitors with vision challenges will thank you!\\nRelative Sizing Web browsers set a default font-size of 16px.\\nIf your web developer set the font-size to 100% (or didn’t set it at all), your text would render at 16px. If the visitor had changed their default font size to 20px, your text would render at 20px.\\nWhen you set sizes in pixels, though, nothing changes if your visitor adjusts their default font size.\\nMany web designers like the control this gives them, but relative sizing is better for usability. It gives control to the visitor and allows people who have accessibility needs (for example, someone who’s visually impaired and needs to read at larger font-sizes) the ability to modify the content to fit their needs. Additionally, many non-desktop devices use a larger base font size to improve readability.\\nYou don’t have to worry about this breaking your layout. If all of your sizing uses relative values, then when the default font-size changes in a visitor’s browser, all of the site elements will scale with it. This also ensures that if someone uses their browser\\u0026rsquo;s zoom feature, you site doesn\\u0026rsquo;t introduces horizontal scroll bars.\\nNot sure how to get started? Check out Working with Relative Sizing.\\nClick Target Size and Spacing Touch screens can be imprecise, especially for those of us that (ahem) have fat, clumsy fingers. Links and other clickable or tappable elements should have enough size and space around them that they\\u0026rsquo;re easily tapped.\\nHow much size and spacing, exactly? From Google:\\n You should ensure that the most important tap targets on your site—the ones users will be using the most often—are large enough to be easy to press, at least 48 CSS pixels tall/wide (assuming you have configured your viewport properly). Less frequently-used links can be smaller, but should still have spacing between them and other links, so that a 10mm finger pad would not accidentally press both links at once. Users should not have to pinch zoom (or rely on other browser UI features for disambiguating finger taps, such as Chrome\\u0026rsquo;s popup magnifying glass) in order to easily and reliably press the desired button or link.\\n Recommendations on the actual pixel size of tap areas vary wildly by device manufacturer, and are impossible to accurately calculate when screen resolution and pixel density differ so greatly. Your best bet? Get your clumsiest friend and have them test your site on a variety of devices.\\nHover Effects on Touch Screens Don\\u0026rsquo;t forget: touch screen users can\\u0026rsquo;t hover.\\nMany devices will register an intial tap as a hover on hover event objects, and then a second tap as a click. On elements that have both hover and click events, this forces your visitor to tap twice to complete their task, which can get be quite frustrating.\\nAvoid hover effects when you can.\\nContrast Good color contrast between your text and the background is an accessibility best practice (and in many countries a legal requirement). It can become even more important on low powered e-ink devices.\\nBecause e-ink devices leave behind remnants of previous text every few page changes, strong contrast is critical to readable text. You can use the WebAIM Color Contrast Checker to test your design. You should also try switching your monitor to grayscale, and use Color Oracle to simulate color blindness when testing your designs.\\nViewport Scaling When smart phones first came out, most websites were not designed for mobile devices. To avoid awkward horizontal scrolling on non-optimized sites, most mobile browsers pretend to have a desktop-sized width.\\nYou need to tell mobile browsers that your site is mobile-optimized so that they get the appropriate zooming and scaling. Add this to the \\u0026lt;head\\u0026gt; element of your site:\\n\\u0026lt;meta name=\\u0026#34;viewport\\u0026#34; content=\\u0026#34;width=device-width, initial-scale=1\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt; Some developers disable user zooming by adding things like user-scalable=no or maximum-scale=1.0. Do not do this.\\nZooming is a critical accessibility feature, and should not be disabled for any reason (A while ago, iOS had a zooming bug when the phone orientation was changed, but it was fixed in iOS6).\\n\",\"summary\":\"There are a handful of small practices\\u0026mdash;little nudges and tweaks\\u0026mdash;that will make a huge impact on the usability of your site across a wide range of devices.\\n\\n\",\"title\":\"Common Mobile User Interface Challenges\",\"url\":\"https://gomakethings.com/common-responsive-ui-challenges/\"},{\"categories\":[\"Design and UX\"],\"content\":\"The following post was adapted from Wicked Fast Websites, my free beginner\\u0026rsquo;s guide to building fast websites and web apps that work on any device.

It\\u0026rsquo;s not, but that\\u0026rsquo;s because there\\u0026rsquo;s a catch.\\n\\nMeasuring the right things Historically, developers have looked at things like total load time and page weight as the key metrics for performance. While those are important, there are two that matter a lot more:\\n Time to First Byte, which tells you how quickly your server is sending data back to the browser after a user types in your URL. Time to Start Render, which is how quickly the browser begins displaying content to your visitor after they type in your URL.  Your whole site doesn\\u0026rsquo;t need to load in 1 second for it to feel fast. It just needs to start displaying content in that amount of time.\\nPerceived performance is more important than actual performance. The rest of this guide will be focused on how to improve start render time on your responsive websites.\\nThe right tool for the job If you\\u0026rsquo;re serious about web performance, you should become familiar with WebPagetest. Originally built by AOL, it was opened source in 2008 and is now maintained by Google.\\nWebPagetest provides a simple, web-based GUI that measures a ton of performance metrics about your site:\\n Total Load Time Time to First Byte Start Render Time Speed Index And more!  It provides this data for both initial load and subsequent visits, and allows you to test your site on a variety of devices, from different locations, using different bandwidths. Best of all, WebPagetest provides a \\u0026ldquo;filmstrip\\u0026rdquo; view that shows you the site\\u0026rsquo;s render progress in 100ms intervals, which is insanely useful.\\nOther Important Measurements While start render time is critically important (and influenced by time to first byte), other metrics are still worth considering.\\nLengthy total load time can have a negative impact on a visitor\\u0026rsquo;s experience. Ever been on a site where content is still showing up (and shifting elements around) after 20 or 30 seconds? It\\u0026rsquo;s annoying.\\nTotal page weight can impact overall site speeds, but it also can have a big impact on visitors using mobile devices with restricted data plans. Tim Kadlec has put together an awesome tool called What does my site cost? that illustrates page weight in more meaningful terms.\\nIt mashes up data about your site from WebPagetest with average data costs around the globe and financial metrics from the World Bank to provide you with a few different views of what your site costs to visitors around the world. When lobbying for performance, this is nice, tangible metric to share with stakeholders.\\n\",\"summary\":\"The following post was adapted from Wicked Fast Websites, my free beginner\\u0026rsquo;s guide to building fast websites and web apps that work on any device.

A horizontal list of links. A select menu. An anchor link that takes you to a vertical navigation list at the bottom of the page. And on, and on, and on\\u0026hellip;  So which one you should choose?\\n\\nResponsive Navigation Guidelines There\\u0026rsquo;s no one right way to implement navigation for smaller viewports, but there are some guidelines you should keep in mind for a better user experience.\\n Don\\u0026rsquo;t use a select menu. Forms as navigation are both unsemantic and confusing to visitors. Many solutions require the use of JavaScript. Make sure that navigation is still accessible before your JS file has loaded (or if it fails altogether). An anchor link that brings you to footer navigation can be jarring and and unexpected. If you go with this approach, it may be worth animating the scroll so that visitors understand they\\u0026rsquo;ve moved to a new location. You should also provide a link back to the original anchor link. Avoid multi-level navigation patterns, as they can be quite confusing on smaller viewports. If your navigation is small enough that it can displayed on one-line on smaller screens, don\\u0026rsquo;t hide it. Keeping the links exposed makes it easier for visitors to find what they\\u0026rsquo;re looking for. Avoid fixed headers. They eat up valuable real estate on smaller screens.  If you want to get up and running quickly, I\\u0026rsquo;ve put together a collection of five mobile-friendly navigation patterns that you can use on your project, as well as a set of responsive drop-down menus that are designed to work well with them.\\nAbout the Hamburger You may be familiar with the \\u0026ldquo;hamburger icon,\\u0026rdquo; those three horizontal lines stacked one of top of the other, as a symbol for the navigation menu. It\\u0026rsquo;s an approach that was popularized, and then later abondoned, by Facebook.\\nThere\\u0026rsquo;s a growing body of research that the icon is confusing and not easily recognizable to many users, and that you should instead use a more obvious word like \\u0026ldquo;Menu\\u0026rdquo; or \\u0026ldquo;Navigation\\u0026rdquo;. Here are some articles on it if you wanted to explore this more deeply:\\n Hamburger vs. Menu: The Final AB Test Apple on Hamburger Menus The Hamburger is Bad for You  And as a counterpoint, here\\u0026rsquo;s some data from Bookings.com that it\\u0026rsquo;s really not a big deal: Would you like fries with that?\\nSo who should you believe?

Download it here.\\nOver the last two years, PAWS New England has been visited by over 800 different devices. These devices range from the very capable (the latest iOS and Android versions) to the very old and underpowered (a Nintendo DS and my 5 year old Kindle).\\nThough it hasn\\u0026rsquo;t actually been tested on 800 devices, the site works on all of them. In this section, we\\u0026rsquo;ll look at techniques that you can use to support a nearly infinite number of devices, even if you can only test a small fraction of them.\\n\\nThe Secret Sauce: Progressive Enhancement Progressive enhancement is the secret to supporting a nearly infinite number of devices without losing your mind. So what is progressive enhancement? To quote Team Treehouse:\\n Progressive enhancement is a layered approach for building websites using HTML for content, CSS for presentation, and JavaScript for interactivity. If for some reason JavaScript breaks, the site should still work and look good. If the CSS doesn’t load correctly, the HTML content should still be there with meaningful hyperlinks. And even if the HTML is malformed, browsers are smart enough to continue rendering what they can. Progressive enhancement typically yields a result that is robust, fault tolerant, and accessible. People that have the latest devices will get the most progressively enhanced experience, and people on slow connections or less capable devices will still be able to access the information. Websites don’t need to look the same in every browser, they just need to deliver core content and functionality.\\n Progressive enhancement is about building in successive layers.\\nBuilding in Layers There are three main layers of the front-end development stack: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\\n Write solid, semantic markup that will logically make sense without CSS or JavaScript. Next, layer in visual style with CSS, and ensure that it will work and look decent even if your JavaScript fails to load. Finally, add interaction with JavaScript, but know that this is a nice-to-have rather than a need-to-have.  Progressive Enhancement with JavaScript Some of my scripts use CSS to hide and show elements. By default, I want all elements visible. They should only be hidden if the browser has the appropriate JavaScript support and my JS file successfully loads. To do that, I include this snippet in my JavaScript file:\\ndocument.documentElement.className += \\u0026#39; js\\u0026#39;;  This adds a .js class to my \\u0026lt;html\\u0026gt; element. I can check for this class in my CSS before hiding any content:\\n.js .example { display: none; visibility: hidden; } If your script is dependent on certain APIs that aren\\u0026rsquo;t supported by all browsers (things like query selectors and event listeners), you should check for those before running your script or adding your class:\\nif ( \\u0026#39;querySelector\\u0026#39; in document \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; \\u0026#39;addEventListener\\u0026#39; in window ) { // Do stuff... \\tdocument.documentElement.className += \\u0026#39; js\\u0026#39;; }  If your JavaScript file fails to load (because of a broken URL, a corporate firewall, or a bad wireless connection), and while your visitor is waiting for it to download, all of your content is still visible and accessible.\\nThat popular JavaScript framework you\\u0026rsquo;re using Today\\u0026rsquo;s most popular MVC JavaScript frameworks-ones like Angular, Backbone, Ember, and more-render markup primarily using JavaScript, and therefore do not support progressive enhancement.\\nNot only does this make them far more fragile (if the JS file fails, the user gets an empty page), performance suffers greatly as well. The folks at Filament Group found that JavaScript frameworks can take 4 seconds or more to display the first piece of content to a user. As we learned in the first section, even fractions of a second have meaningful bottom-line impacts on your business.\\nThe good news: there\\u0026rsquo;s a push towards isomorphic JavaScript, scripts that can be run on both the server and in the browser. You get faster initial load times from the server, and faster updates from the browser. And if the JS file fails to load, you simply fallback to the server and the visitor still gets all of your content.\\nThe bad news: We\\u0026rsquo;re not there yet with most of today\\u0026rsquo;s most popular JavaScript frameworks.\\nMobile First Mobile first, from a coding perspective, means that your base style is typically a single-column, fully-fluid layout. You use @media (min-width: whatever) to add a grid-based layout on top of that.\\nThe alternative – desktop first – involves starting with a wide, grid-based layout, and using @media (max-width: whatever) to scale down to a single-column layout. When we all began converting our desktop-only sites to responsive design, it was common to use a desktop-first approach because it made retrofitting easier.\\nMobile-first is the better more future-friendly approach. Here\\u0026rsquo;s an example of desktop-first code, borrowed from our chapter on RWD:\\n#main { width: 66.666666667%; } #sidebar { width: 33.333333333%; } @media (max-width: 480px) { #main, #sidebar { width: 100%; } } And here\\u0026rsquo;s that same code, rewritten mobile-first:\\n#main, #sidebar { width: 100%; } @media (min-width: 480px) { #main { width: 66.666666667%; } #sidebar { width: 33.333333333%; } } Why mobile first? iPhone and Android browsers are quite capable, but older smart phones, feature phones and other small-screen devices like gaming consoles may not support media queries.\\nImagine trying to read tiny text in a big screen layout on an old, underpowered feature phone.\\nMobile first web design extends progressive enhancement to site layout, allowing you to serve simple, readable content to all devices, and layer on structure and presentation for more capable devices.\\nIt\\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that IE 8 and lower do not support media queries, so they receive the basic, single-column layout when using this approach. There is a simple way to address this if you really need to optimize for IE 8.\\nSupport is not the same as optimization The web is for everyone, but support is not the same as optimization.\\nRather than trying to provide the same level of functionality for older browsers, use progressive enhancement to serve a basic experience to all browsers (even Netscape and IE 5), and layer in a better layout, more visually attractive elements, and an enhanced experience for newer browsers that support modern APIs and techniques.\\nThis will let you build engaging, feature rich web experiences, support any browser that can connect to the web, and maintain your sanity.\\nDoes this mean I don\\u0026rsquo;t have to test my site? No. Testing on real devices will still surface unexpected layout quirks and interaction challenges. Test on as many real devices as you can, but acknoweldge that you can\\u0026rsquo;t test everything. Come with up a sensible policy and stick to it.\\nThis seems reasonable: \\u0026ldquo;We test on the current and last major release of iOS and Android. We also test on the latest versions of all modern browsers, as well as the latest version of IE and two versions prior.\\u0026rdquo;\\n\",\"summary\":\"The following post was adapted from Wicked Fast Websites, my free beginner\\u0026rsquo;s guide to building fast websites and web apps that work on any device.

This added about 500ms—that’s just half a second—of extra load time to the page.\\nThe result? Search traffic, and subsequently ad revenues, decreased by 20-percent.\\n\\nAmazon ran a similar experiment, and found that delays of as little as one-tenth of a second had a negative impact on revenue:\\n In A/B tests, we tried delaying the page in increments of 100 milliseconds and found that even very small delays would result in substantial and costly drops in revenue. - Greg Linden\\n Sites are getting bigger In 2009, the average website was 320kb. By 2010, it had almost doubled to 600kb. At the beginning of 2013, that number had tripled to 1.2mb. At the time of writing, the average website had ballooned to over 2mb in size. That\\u0026rsquo;s six times larger than in 2009!\\nFor a while, this exponential growth wasn\\u0026rsquo;t a problem. We took for granted that both computers and bandwidth got faster and more reliable every year. And then mobile happened.\\nMobile WTF! People are accessing the web from devices with varying levels of computing power and bandwidth. Desktops and laptops, phones and tablets, TVs, watches, video game consoles.\\nAnd for a growing number of people, mobile isn’t just one way they access the web—it’s the way they access the web.\\nA study by Google and Nielsen found that 77-percent of mobile searches happen at home or at work, locations where you would expect someone to have access to a PC. I’m sure you’ve experienced this before. You’re laying on the couch, you just got comfortable, and you realize you need to look something up. Rather than getting up and walking to whatever room you keep your laptop in, you just pull out the computer you always have with you—your phone—and Google it.\\nHarvard Business Review reported that 55-percent of Americans accessed the internet via a mobile device in 2012. The only surprising thing about that number is how low it is. But that same report also found that almost a third of all Americans used a mobile device as the primary way they access the internet.\\nMobile isn’t just one way people access the web. For a growing number, it’s the only way.\\nGreater Performance Expectations Amazingly, despite the varied power and bandwidth of mobile devices, users expect them to be faster than desktops. Forty-percent of visitors abandon a website that takes more than 3-seconds to load\\nI’ve heard people argue that it doesn’t matter. 4G LTE, they say, is as fast as broadband wifi. And they’re right. LTE is awesome!\\nUntil I go into Target or Home Depot. Or I hit that patch of trees down the street from my house, where I can\\u0026rsquo;t even pull an EDGE network. Or when there’s a bad storm, and I still get internet, but it’s not LTE. And that’s here in the United States where we have a fantastic mobile infrastructure.\\nIn developing nations, things are far less predictable, and that’s where mobile growth is really soaring.\\nMobile is overtaking desktop traffic In the summer of 2012, India had an important milestone: mobile traffic overtook desktop traffic. China passed a similar milestone at the end of 2012. And in Korea, mobile search queries overtook desktop search queries.\\nMobile traffic is surpassing desktop traffic, and not just in developing nations.\\nPAWS New England is a client of mine. They\\u0026rsquo;re an all-breed dog rescue based out of-you guessed it-New England.\\nIn May of 2011, mobile traffic accounted for just 9 percent of their overall traffic. That year, they switched from a desktop-only site to responsive web design. Twelve months later, mobile traffic was almost a quarter of all traffic to the site. And in March of 2014, mobile traffic surpassed desktop traffic, accounting for 52-percent of all traffic to the site.\\nWhile much of it comes from iOS devices, they had one visitor from a Nintendo DS, several from a Nintendo Wii, and an assortment of other (mostly Android-powered) smartphones and tablets.\\nThe Perfect Storm There’s a myth about mobile users—that they’re always on-the-go and distracted, fleeting consumers of content.\\nBut PAWS found that people aren’t just looking at dogs. They’re submitting (lengthy) application forms and making donations, too. Losing visitors to poor performance means fewer dogs saved and less money to fund their work.\\nWe’re in the middle of a perfect storm. Websites are larger, devices are more varied and less predictable, and performance expectations are higher than ever.\\nMobile-friendly, fast websites make more money  Google factors in mobile-friendliness and page speed when determining page rank. A study by the Aberdeen Group found that sites that used responsive web design had more brand awareness, higher revenues, higher visitor-to-buyer conversion rates, higher visitor engagement, and higher average order value than non-responsive sites. Mobile-friendly sites scored higher in virtually every important metric. Think Tank Photo conducted a responsive redesign on their site, and saw a 188-percent increase in Black Friday revenue versus the year before. O\\u0026rsquo;Neill Clothing converted to responsive web design in 2013. They saw mobile conversion rates increase by 162-percent (compared to 71-percent on desktop devices) and mobile revenue increase by 370-percent (versus 136-percent on desktop devices). Forty-percent of users abandon a website that takes more than 3-seconds to load. That number increases to 74-percent after 5 seconds.

It took me 15 minutes to sketch a quick outline of how I thought the book should flow.\\nThe first few chapters were written from scratch. They were kind a grand unifying theory of what the heck my book was supposed to be about. But after that, I was able to borrow heavily from stuff I had already written.\\nMost of the chapters in the book are modified, updated, or expanded blog posts from this site.\\nThe Process and Tools I wrote the whole book in markdown in Sublime Text. Each chapter was its own file, ordered by number. I used GitHub to backup my work (and for version control).\\nI wrote the whole thing in about two days, then spent a third reading, making some light edits, and polishing. I added a chapter on content parity across devices to fill in what felt like a hole in the story.\\nDesigning the Book The design of the book was all done in OSX Pages. I\\u0026rsquo;ve always used Word, but Pages provides \\u0026ldquo;export as epub\\u0026rdquo; functionality. It was an absolute delight to use.\\nThis is where my obsession with markdown came back to bite me. I had to do a lot of copy-and-pasting to add formatting, remove markdown style elements, and add links. In retrospect, I should used a markdown editor that displayed formatted text I could have copied into Pages instead. Live and learn.\\nPublishing the Book I exported from Pages into a PDF, and then again as an EPUB. I downloaded Calibre and used that to convert the EPUB into a MOBI file. Exporting all the formats took less than five minutes.\\nReleasing the Book Everything lives on the server for this site, and is served via a simple link to the file (which triggers a download for most of the file formats).\\nI use Google Analytics Events to track the downloads. It\\u0026rsquo;s a simple onclick event on the download links.\\nI had originally just included a link to a zip file with all three file formats. Then I realized someone may want to just immediately start reading on their mobile device, so I added separate links for the individual file formats as well.\\nWhat I Learned Momentum is your friend. If I didn\\u0026rsquo;t knock this out in a week, it would have taken me a month.\\nWrite about what you know. Better yet, refine and polish what you\\u0026rsquo;ve already written about. This felt easy because I had done so much of the leg work already.\\nThe right tools make a difference. I\\u0026rsquo;ve fought with Word in the past to create ebooks. Pages made it so much easier.\\nJust ship the darn thing. There are a few typos in the book. I proofread it a few times but still missed some things. I wish the table of contents linked to the chapters, too. And the one image in the book doesn\\u0026rsquo;t resize properly on smaller screens, so it\\u0026rsquo;s cropped off.\\nBut getting something pretty good out there for people to use matters more than perfect. I can always go back and release an updated version later.\\nI actually used semantic versioning for the book itself. So the initial release is v1.0.0. Typo fixes would be v1.0.x changes. Additions to content would be v1.x.0 changes. Changes in content due to evolving practices would be major version changes (ie. vx.0.0).\\nIt was a lot of fun, and I plan to do this again soon.

The dist files are the ones I link to in WordPress. When compiling my CSS and JS files, Gulp adds the current version number from my package.json file to the end of the file name. So main.css becomes main.v1.2.3.css. I keep an empty file in my src directory named style.css. Gulp adds all of the WordPress theme stylesheet header, including dynamically assigning the theme version from my package.json file. This file goes into the main theme directory rather than dist. When loading my external CSS and JavaScript files, I use WordPress to get the version number from my theme, so that it\\u0026rsquo;s always pulling the right file based on the current theme.

Even a recent web app I built, which unlike those new hottness single-page apps still uses server-side rendered code, was navigable and displayed all of the key content.\\nHowever, there are a few gotchas.\\nThe Kindle completely ignores CSS and JavaScript A few of my progressively enhanced scripts use CSS to hide JS-dependent elements (ex. toggles for expand-and-collapse widgets) until the JavaScript files are loaded and initialized.\\nElements hidden with CSS are visible, creating redundant, confusing markup.\\nBecause the Kindle ignores both CSS and JS, those elements are visible, and this results in some confusing markup. Inline CSS and JavaScript don\\u0026rsquo;t appear to be rendered either, so I\\u0026rsquo;m not sure how to address this.\\nUpdate: A few folks\\u0026mdash;in the comments here and on Twitter\\u0026mdash;have pointed out that my Kindle is old as heck, and newer e-ink models like the Paperwhite have robust CSS and JavaScript support.\\nThe Kindle ignores anchor links As an accessibility best practice, I include a skip navigation link at the top of my documents. This hidden anchor link let\\u0026rsquo;s screen reader users skip the navigation and jump right to the body content\\u0026mdash;handy when navigating several pages of content using in-document links.\\nThe skip nav link is displayed visibly (again, because CSS is ignored), and I\\u0026rsquo;m ok with that. But clicking the link doesn\\u0026rsquo;t actually skip the navigation as it should. That\\u0026rsquo;s bad for UX and accessibility (and also means anchor links don\\u0026rsquo;t work).\\nSVGs and web fonts aren\\u0026rsquo;t supported Not surprisingly, SVGs aren\\u0026rsquo;t supported, and neither are custom fonts (even web-safe ones). Everything is rendered in the Kindle\\u0026rsquo;s default system font.\\nImages display just fine My sites included both JPGs and PNGs, and both of those rendered without issue (albeit in grayscale).\\nUpdate: Contrast Is Important In the comments, Nico pointed out that color contrast is critically important for e-ink displays. They have a tendency to leave remnants of previous text when scrolling, making lighter text harder to read.\\nFollow a11y recommendations for color contrast and you should be good here.\\nKey Takeaways Generally speaking, if you follow web accessibility best practices, you\\u0026rsquo;ll be in great shape. The basics for supporting almost any device:\\n Write solid, semantic markup that will logically make sense without CSS or JavaScript. Next, layer in visual style with CSS, and ensure that it will work and look decent even if your JavaScript fails to load. Finally, add interaction with JavaScript, but know that this is a nice-to-have rather than a need-to-have.  Frankly, this is the first browser I\\u0026rsquo;ve encountered that flat-out ignores CSS. That introduces some weird markup that I\\u0026rsquo;m not sure how to address. I could render my JS toggling elements with JavaScript if and when the file successfully loads and runs, but that\\u0026rsquo;s bad for performance.\\nAt this time, I\\u0026rsquo;m thinking that this is such an edge case, having a site that\\u0026rsquo;s useable and includes all content (along with some weird markup) is good enough.\\nUpdate: At the recommendation of Brad Frost and a few others on Twitter, I\\u0026rsquo;m leaning towards rendering DOM that only works if JavaScript is loaded via JavaScript, thereby avoiding the weirdly rendered markup.\\n\",\"summary\":\"Today, Brad Frost wrote about the importance of providing accessible web experiences on low-powered devices (like an e-ink Kindle).\\n My wife’s cousin suffers from debilitating migraines.

I failed miserably.\\nAt the time, my site was already displaying content after 700ms, but the updates I made were increasing start render time rather than reducing it.\\nLast week, I took another shot at it and succeeded. My site now starts rendering content in about 400-500ms, a 40-percent reduction. Here\\u0026rsquo;s how I did it.\\n\\nThe starting point and what numbers to look at I test my site\\u0026rsquo;s performance using WebPageTest.org. Historically, developers have looked at load time as the key metric for performance. While it\\u0026rsquo;s somewhat important, there are two that matter a lot more:\\n Time to First Byte, which tells you how quickly your server is sending data back to the browser after a user types in your URL. Time to Start Render, which is how quickly the browser begins displaying content to your visitor after they type in your URL.  First byte is typically server related, while first render is largely a matter of how you structure your CSS and markup\\u0026mdash;though obviously a slow time to first byte will impact your time to start render. This article will be largely focused on start render time, though I will touch briefly on time to first byte near the end.\\nMy website\\u0026rsquo;s baseline performance     First View Subsequent Views     Landing Page ~950ms ~700ms   Blog 711ms 322ms    Note: I don\\u0026rsquo;t have the exact numbers on the landing page because I forgot to save the test before making my updates.\\nThe Strategy I\\u0026rsquo;d already done quite a bit to improve the performance of this site.\\nYour stylesheet is neccessary for rendering content properly, but while it\\u0026rsquo;s being downloaded and parsed, it also blocks any rendering from happening. To get around this challenge, an emerging technique recommended by both Google and Filament Group is to inline your critical path CSS. Yes, that\\u0026rsquo;s right. Inline your CSS.\\nIt works like this:\\n Extract the styles that apply to above-the-fold content and load them inline in the \\u0026lt;head\\u0026gt;. Load your full stylesheet asynchronously so that the rest of your page can continue downloading and rendering.  Sounds wacky, but it makes a big difference.\\nHow to decide what to inline When I mentioned this technique to a few folks on Twitter, the most common question was how I decided what to inline.\\nIf you use a JS task runner like Gulp or Grunt, there are a few plugins you can use to automate this: Critical by Addy Osmani and Critical CSS by Filament Group. Addy also created an online generator if command line isn\\u0026rsquo;t thing.\\nI didn\\u0026rsquo;t use any of these.\\nI tried using them, and found that they often left out styles important for rendering layout on smaller or taller viewports (as in, my iPhone), so I created my critical CSS manually. Easier than you\\u0026rsquo;d think!\\nUsing Sass If you still write vanilla CSS, this may be a fair bit harder. Because I work with Sass and keep my all of my components in their own modular files, doing this manually was a breeze.\\nI import all off my Sass components into a main.scss file. I created a second file, critical.scss, and used it to import just the critical path components, eliminating any need to write code twice or do lots of copy-and-pasting.\\nHere are the components I included:\\n Normalize.css My grid system Typography basics Button styling SVG styles for my icons Navigation styles Utility classes  The magic number All told, my critical path CSS was about 9kb minified, closer to 3kb after gzipping.\\nThe magic number you should care about is 14kb. That\\u0026rsquo;s (give or take) how much data a server sends per round trip when the browser makes a request for a web page. You want your above-the-fold content\\u0026mdash;required styles, scripts, markup, everything\\u0026mdash;to weight 14kb or less so that the browser can start rendering it as soon as that first packet of data is received.\\nHow to inline and async your CSS The inlining piece is pretty straightforward. Add the contents of your critical CSS file to your \\u0026lt;head\\u0026gt; element inside a \\u0026lt;style\\u0026gt; tag:\\n\\u0026lt;head\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;!-- Your other header markup --\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;style\\u0026gt; .some-styles { font-weight: bold; } ... .etc-etc { color: #333333; } \\u0026lt;/style\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;/head\\u0026gt; Rather than adding your full stylesheet via a \\u0026lt;link\\u0026gt; element as you normally would, I used loadCSS.js from the Filament Group (inlined in the \\u0026lt;head\\u0026gt;) to load it asynchronously. There\\u0026rsquo;s no natively supported way to load CSS files async (as there is with JS), so this script helps prevent render blocking.\\n\\u0026lt;head\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;!-- Your other header markup --\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;script\\u0026gt; function loadCSS( href, before, media, callback ){ ... } loadCSS( \\u0026#39;/path/to/your/full.css\\u0026#39; ); \\u0026lt;/script\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;style\\u0026gt; .some-styles { font-weight: bold; } ... .etc-etc { color: #333333; } \\u0026lt;/style\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;/head\\u0026gt; Then, I added a \\u0026lt;noscript\\u0026gt; fallback in the footer (again, to prevent render blocking) for browsers that don\\u0026rsquo;t support JavaScript or have it turned off.\\n\\u0026lt;noscript\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;link href=\\u0026#39;/path/to/your/full.css\\u0026#39; rel=\\u0026#39;stylesheet\\u0026#39; type=\\u0026#39;text/css\\u0026#39;\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;/noscript\\u0026gt; What about browser caching? This brought my start render times below 500ms. Not too shabby. However, it also meant that the browser was no longer able to take advantage of having my stylesheet cached for reuse on subsequent pages and visits.\\nFortunately, there was a relatively easy way to get around this, developed by the wonderfully talented folks at Filament Group: Set a cookie when the full stylesheet is loaded asynchronously, and then check for that cookie on subsequent page visits. If it\\u0026rsquo;s there, skip the critical CSS inlining and just load the stylesheet via a traditional \\u0026lt;link\\u0026gt; element.\\nThis does, of course, require some server-side logic.\\nSetting the cookie with loadCSS Setting the cookie requires one additional, super lightweight script from the Filament Group, onloadCSS.js that runs a callback when the CSS file is loaded.\\n\\u0026lt;head\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;!-- Your other header markup --\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;script\\u0026gt; function loadCSS( href, before, media, callback ){ ... } var stylesheet = loadCSS( \\u0026#39;/path/to/your/full.css\\u0026#39; ); onloadCSS( stylesheet, function() { var expires = new Date(+new Date + (7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)).toUTCString(); document.cookie = \\u0026#39;fullCSS=true; expires=\\u0026#39; + expires; }); \\u0026lt;/script\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;!-- Your inline CSS --\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;/head\\u0026gt; The example code above sets a cookie called fullCSS that expires after a week.\\nServer-side logic in WordPress Implementation for this will vary based on your CMS and server technology. I use WordPress.

Every. Single. Time. This is common for most CMS-based websites.\\nI also run my site on cheap, shared hosting, so all of that server work can really impact time to first byte. To improve performance and minimize server load, I use ZenCache, a caching plugin.\\nZenCache pre-compiles all of the pages on my site into static HTML files and serves those when people visit a page instead of requiring WordPress to build them fresh every time. It also automatically updates the static files whenever I make an update to a page.\\nWhat makes ZenCache really shine, though, is that it provides me with a way to server two separate versions of a page based on whether or not that fullCSS coookie is set.\\nCookie-specific cached pages in WordPress If you buy the Pro version of ZenCache, there\\u0026rsquo;s a GUI way to do this in the WordPress dashboard.

Because of the hosting I use, these numbers can sometimes run ~100ms higher. A better hosting solution (for example, Digital Ocean\\u0026rsquo;s SSD Cloud Servers) might improve the metrics even more.\\nYou may also have noticed that my subsequent page load times went up a little bit on blog pages.

They\\u0026rsquo;re lightweight, scalable, and easily styleable with CSS.\\nI recently made the switch to using SVG, and I\\u0026rsquo;m not looking back. This article details how I currently work with SVG.\\n\\nWhy I made the switch to SVG Icon fonts worked great for me for quite a while. There are two major reasons why I switched to SVG.\\nFirst, icon fonts were and are a hack. A brilliant hack, but a hack nonethless. And that resulted in some weird, unpredictable failures. Chris Coyier ellaborates:\\n Icon fonts seem to fail in weird ways. For instance, you map the characters to normal letters, then the font loading fails and you get random characters abound. Or you map to \\u0026ldquo;Private Use Area\\u0026rdquo; and some browsers decide to re-map them to really weird characters like roses, but it\\u0026rsquo;s hard to replicate. Or you want to host the @font-face files on a CDN, but that\\u0026rsquo;s cross-origin and Firefox hates that, so you need your server to serve the right cross-origin headers, but your Nginx setup isn\\u0026rsquo;t picking that up right, SIGH.\\n Second, and this one is huge for me: SVGs are simply easier to maintain and work with. You\\u0026rsquo;ll see why when I explain how I work with them.\\nOne additional win for SVG: Multi-color icon support is much easier with SVG.\\nHow I include SVG files There are lots of different ways you can work with SVGs. I use two different approaches, depending on the use case:\\n Inline SVG. This is where you take the content of the SVG file and include it directly in your markup. This method is straightforward, and let\\u0026rsquo;s you directly target each shape within the SVG with CSS. SVG Sprites. If I\\u0026rsquo;ll be using a set of icons across multiple pages, I instead use an SVG sprite. This method works allows you to include an SVG by referencing its ID, and makes it easy to change an icon and have those changes reflected instantly across a site (so long as the ID remains the same).  How to use an inline SVG Open the SVG file in your text editor of choice, and then literally copy and paste the content from the file into your markup.\\n\\u0026lt;svg\\u0026gt;...\\u0026lt;/svg\\u0026gt; How to create an SVG sprite My Gulp boilerplate (available on GitHub) includes an SVG sprite generator. I simply drop all of my SVG files into the svg folder, run my build, and it generates a sprite for me. Super easy to add and remove icons.\\nHowever, this approach requires comfort working with command line, and if you\\u0026rsquo;re not there, that\\u0026rsquo;s ok. IcoMoon, the fantastic icon font generator, also now lets you easily create SVG sprites.\\n Pick your icons. Click the \\u0026ldquo;Generate SVG/PNG\\u0026rdquo; button in the lower left-hand corner. Click \\u0026ldquo;Download\\u0026rdquo;. The svgdefs.svg is your SVG sprite.  How to use an SVG sprite Add the contents of your sprite to the markup in a hidden container.\\n\\u0026lt;div hidden\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;svg\\u0026gt;...\\u0026lt;/svg\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt; To use an icon, simply reference its ID using the \\u0026lt;use\\u0026gt; element.\\n\\u0026lt;svg class=\\u0026#34;icon\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;use xlink:href=\\u0026#34;#icon-logo\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/use\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;/svg\\u0026gt; Add some simple styling with CSS (the .svg class is added via a simple feature detection script).\\n/** * Hide icons by default to prevent blank spaces in unsupported browsers */ .icon { display: inline-block; fill: currentColor; height: 0; width: 0; } /** * Display icons when browser supports SVG. * Inherit height, width, and color. */ .svg .icon { height: 1em; width: 1em; } External SVG sprites Instead of embedding, you can link to the SVG as an external file. However, this method is not supported in Internet Explorer and requires you to use svg4everybody, a JavaScript polyfill. I\\u0026rsquo;ve also found that inlining the sprite results in faster peceived performance.\\nWhile this will gain you some browser caching benefits, I\\u0026rsquo;ve found that perceived load times are better using the inlined sprite approach, as the icons are rendered immediately.\\nAutomating sprite embedding with WordPress If you\\u0026rsquo;re using WordPress, you can configure your theme to automatically add your SVG sprite into your markup without having to manually update files when you make changes. Add this to your header.php file, right after the opening \\u0026lt;body\\u0026gt; tag (update the path to point to your SVG sprite in your theme directory).\\n\\u0026lt;div hidden\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;?php echo file_get_contents( get_template_directory_uri() . \\u0026#39;/path/to/your/svg-sprite.svg\\u0026#39; ); ?\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt;  Browser Compatibility SVG is well supported in IE 9 and up, and all modern browsers, as well as Opera Mini (new development!).\\nFallbacks I implement a simple feature text inline in the \\u0026lt;head\\u0026gt;.

For sighted users, it\\u0026rsquo;s difficult to read. For about 5-percent of the male population, those suffering from a few forms of colorblindness, it\\u0026rsquo;s completely unusable.\\nI explained my concerns.

The problem is, you don\\u0026rsquo;t hire me to cater to your tastes. My job as a web professional is to make my clients successful, and sometimes that means pushing back on bad decisions.\\nHere\\u0026rsquo;s what I did.\\n1. Have the tough conversation It was pretty obvious to me that my client wasn\\u0026rsquo;t comfortable pushing back on the CEO. So I offered to do it.\\nI don\\u0026rsquo;t have to work there every day, and I understand the implications of the proposed solution. I can have a conversation that someone well below the CEO on the reporting structure might not feel comfortable having.\\nWhat\\u0026rsquo;s more, the CEO may not \\u0026ldquo;like white backgrounds,\\u0026rdquo; but that doesn\\u0026rsquo;t automatically mean you need to use the existing gray on black. There are plenty of other combinations that fit in the brand color palette, are accessible, and attractive.\\nThis suggestion was immediately dismissed.\\n2. Appeal to data Given the desire to please the CEO, I thought data might be a more effective approach.\\n\\u0026ldquo;Did you know that with the proposed solution, about 5-percent of the male visitors to your site won\\u0026rsquo;t be able to use it effectively?\\u0026rdquo; Surely the CEO would want to maximize visitors who can use a site, no?\\nMaybe, but my contact at the client site still didn\\u0026rsquo;t feel comfortable moving forward, data or not.\\n3. The legal implications At this point, you may be thinking, \\u0026ldquo;Why not just do what the client wants and move on?\\u0026rdquo;\\nBecause clients don\\u0026rsquo;t hire me because I make them happy. I mean, I do that, too. But my job is make them successful. That\\u0026rsquo;s how I make them happy. And this was a decision that would be detrimental to their success.\\nMy last attempt: appeal to the legal implications. I sent them the American\\u0026rsquo;s With Disabilities Act specifications on Web Accessibility, and specifically called out the section on color contrast and vision impairment.\\nI mentioned that going forward with their proposed solution might put them at risk of violating the Act, and offered an alternate solution. Use almost-black text on a light-gray background. It\\u0026rsquo;s not white, and it\\u0026rsquo;s a pattern that was already in use on their existing site.\\nThat did the trick.\\nGetting the confidence to tell a client \\u0026ldquo;no\\u0026rdquo; Until recently, I didn\\u0026rsquo;t feel comfortable telling clients \\u0026ldquo;no.\\u0026rdquo; I believed my job was to do what they asked me to do.\\nThen I discovered Mike Monteiro.\\nFirst, his talk, F*ck You, Pay Me*, which influenced how I set up my freelance business. Then, his book, *Design is a Job, which is required reading for anyone in a creative field who interacts with clients. Then I saw him talk at An Event Apart Boston about how the things our clients don\\u0026rsquo;t know about design are our fault, not theirs.\\n Mike has done more to influence my thinking around the business of web work than anyone.

From Wikipedia:\\n JSONP or \\u0026ldquo;JSON with padding\\u0026rdquo; is a communication technique used in JavaScript programs running in web browsers to request data from a server in a different domain, something prohibited by typical web browsers because of the same-origin policy. JSONP takes advantage of the fact that browsers do not enforce the same-origin policy on \\u0026lt;script\\u0026gt; tags.\\n Here\\u0026rsquo;s how it works: The API request URL is set as the src of a \\u0026lt;script\\u0026gt; tag, which gets appended to the DOM. That data is then passed into a callback method on load. The callback is included in the request url as ?callback=callbackMethodName;\\nThe Code /** * Get JSONP data for cross-domain AJAX requests * @private * @link http://cameronspear.com/blog/exactly-what-is-jsonp/ * @param {String} url The URL of the JSON request * @param {String} callback The name of the callback to run on load */ var loadJSONP = function ( url, callback ) { // Create script with url and callback (if specified) \\tvar ref = window.document.getElementsByTagName( \\u0026#39;script\\u0026#39; )[ 0 ]; var script = window.document.createElement( \\u0026#39;script\\u0026#39; ); script.src = url + (url.indexOf( \\u0026#39;?\\u0026#39; ) + 1 ? \\u0026#39;\\u0026amp;\\u0026#39; : \\u0026#39;?\\u0026#39;) + \\u0026#39;callback=\\u0026#39; + callback; // Insert script tag into the DOM (append to \\u0026lt;head\\u0026gt;) \\tref.parentNode.insertBefore( script, ref ); // After the script is loaded (and executed), remove it \\tscript.onload = function () { this.remove(); }; };  And here\\u0026rsquo;s an example using the Petfinder API:\\nvar logAPI = function ( data ) { console.log( data ); } getJSONP( \\u0026#39;http://api.petfinder.com/shelter.getPets?format=json\\u0026amp;key=12345\\u0026amp;shelter=AA11\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;logAPI\\u0026#39; );  Client-Side Performance Loading data from APIs can be slow, so you want to minimize the amount of times you have to request data.\\nWith petfinderAPI4everybody.js, I decided to store API data in localStorage so that after initial page load, the data is immediately available for use on each subsequent page load.

You need to ask what the end goal is. Perhaps it’s “enable people to share photos with their friends.” Going back to good ol’ HTML, you can accomplish that task with:\\n\\u0026lt;input type=\\u0026#34;file\\u0026#34; accept=\\u0026#34;image/*\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;  Now that you’ve got that out of the way, you can spend the majority of your time making the best damn camera app you can, using all the latest browser technologies.

Maybe use a canvas element to display the captured image data and apply CSS filters on top?)\\n Hell yea, that\\u0026rsquo;s awesome.\\nIf often have people tell me that it\\u0026rsquo;s unrealistic to expect older browsers to get the same functionality as ones that support modern web technologies.\\nI agree. That\\u0026rsquo;s not the point of progressive enhancement. Jeremy sums it up nicely:\\n If progressive enhancement truly meant making all functionality available to everyone, then it would be unworkable. I think that’s a common misconception around progressive enhancement; there’s this idea that using progressive enhancement means that you’re going to spend all your time making stuff work in older browsers. In fact, it’s the exact opposite. As long as you spend a little bit of time at the start making sure that the core functionality works with good ol’ fashioned HTML, then you can spend most of your time trying out the latest and greatest browser technologies.\\n Since I moved to a progressive enhancement development approach, I find myself spending far less time testing older browsers and much more time working on cool new stuff.

It\\u0026rsquo;s on weak devices with bad connectivity\\u0026mdash;and very powerful ones that are always online. It\\u0026rsquo;s messy. It\\u0026rsquo;s about people, not devices. It doesn\\u0026rsquo;t always involves screens.  The web is for everyone The web has always been about open access to information. But as web technologies become more complex and more powerful, we\\u0026rsquo;ve started to lose some of that openness.\\nWe build sites that simply don\\u0026rsquo;t function is JavaScript fails to load. I\\u0026rsquo;m not talking about people who willingly turn JS off. I\\u0026rsquo;m talking about when the script breaks because you fucked something up, or the mobile browser timed out because the file was taking too long on a shitty Edge network, or a corporate firewall blocked it.\\nAnd then suddenly navigation menus won\\u0026rsquo;t load, hidden content won\\u0026rsquo;t reveal, and in some cases, all you get is an empty white screen.\\nWe build incredibly complex, interactive experiences, but fail to consider how people with physical and cognitive limitations will participate in them. We need to build sites that are tolerant of failures. Sites that work when JavaScript doesn\\u0026rsquo;t, that include the appropriate HTML5 semantic elements and aria roles, and that consider how people who use assistive technologies will interact with them.\\nNot everyone is on the web\\u0026hellip; yet There are 3 billion people\\u0026mdash;almost half the Earth\\u0026rsquo;s human population\\u0026mdash;who have never been online. But thanks to mobile devices, they\\u0026rsquo;ll be coming online over the next decade. And their internet will be very different from the one that I\\u0026rsquo;m used to.\\nMobile will be there only way of accessing the web, rather than an alternative to the desktop experience. It will be on devices that aren\\u0026rsquo;t as powerful as that new iPhone or Nexxus. It will be in places where a reliable Edge network is a luxury, nevermind LTE.\\nAnd yet in other parts the world, the web will also be on increasingly powerful devices. Screens with 3x or 4x pixel density. Massive big-screen TVs. Tiny but fully capable watches. And more and more, we\\u0026rsquo;ll interact with web through devices that don\\u0026rsquo;t have screens at all.\\nIn a word, the future of the web is messy. What an exciting time to be doing what we do!\\nConference Culture Artifact is small. And that\\u0026rsquo;s what makes it so magical.\\nTen minutes after arriving, I had already bumped into and reconnected with half a dozen people I had met last year. You spend both days in one room, together, having a conversation. The speakers are laid back and approachable. The Twitter backchannel is actually a discussion rather than a firehose.\\nAt the end of most conferences, I feel exhausted. After Artifact, I feel exhausted, too. But I also feel something akin to how it felt to leave college. Excited for what\\u0026rsquo;s next, but sad to be moving on.\\nOur profession is a unique one. We give away our best work. We openly share what we learn, even when keeping it secret would be a competitive advantage. We freely help people we don\\u0026rsquo;t know. And we do out of a love for this thing we\\u0026rsquo;re all helping to make.\\nArtifact is the very best of web.

But Askimet was letting through an incredible amount of spam, and managing it was taking up time that I could have spent writing posts and making cool stuff.\\nOver the weekend, I brought comments back and added a new plugin that has stopped comment spam entirely.\\n\\nSpam Honeypots Tarpit reduces comment spam with a smart honeypot that captures spam bots:\\n A honey pot is a field added to the form that the users can’t see due to CSS or JavaScript (which hides the field). Honey pots are awesome because they don’t inconvenience users like a captcha and they are a valid tool for thwarting spam bots. Basically, a spam bot fills in a field that valid users can’t see, alerting us to their activity. If the honey pot field is filled in, we can confidently reject the form as spam.\\n Tarpit was forked from WP Comment Smart Honeypot by Ryan Johnston. Ryan explains:\\n After the honey pot was invented, the spam bot authors got a little smarter. They added some code to detect these hidden fields. If the name of the field is always the same, then the field is really simple to detect.\\n How it works Tarpit (and of course WP Comment Smart Honeypost) does a few things:\\n It adds a field to your comment form that bots can see but users cannot. It gives your real comment form fields random IDs so bots don\\u0026rsquo;t know what they are. It gives your fake comment field the ID of a real comment field (like \\u0026ldquo;name\\u0026rdquo; or \\u0026ldquo;email\\u0026rdquo;), so bots will always fill it out. It randomizes the location of the fake comment field so bots can\\u0026rsquo;t ignore it based on its index.  Ryan\\u0026rsquo;s plugin was dependent on JavaScript, included some Bootstrap-specific styling, and required you to change code in the plugin itself. I removed the dependency and created a settings screen so you can control options from the WordPress dashboard.\\nReally, Ryan did all the hard work and I just made a few slight usability tweaks.\\nI\\u0026rsquo;d also be a ginormous ass if I didn\\u0026rsquo;t give a shoutout to David Walsh. His post on how he stopped WordPress comment spam kicked this whole thing off, and the comments on his post got me pointed in the right direction.\\nThe results Since installing Tarpit, I\\u0026rsquo;ve had zero spam sneak through.

And while we do watching a fair bit of TV, we\\u0026rsquo;re paying for so many channels and programs that we just don\\u0026rsquo;t watch.\\nWe decided to cut the cord and ditch cable. This is how we did it.\\n\\nThe Setup Cutting the cord, ironically, actually requires a bit more equipment than sticking with cable. Part of what you pay for with cable is the convenience of a single box that controls everything. Here\\u0026rsquo;s my setup.\\nServices My cable programming has been replaced by content from the internet.\\n Hulu Plus. This provides access to most of the TV shows I watch. Many are available next day, though some take a week from original air date. Amazon Instant Video. One perk of Amazon Prime is free access to a bunch of streaming video content. We also rent movies and buy full seasons of shows that aren\\u0026rsquo;t available elsewhere through Amazon Instant Video. YouTube. You can find an insane amount of great content on YouTube. HBOGo. This comes with my internet plan (more on that below). Awesome original programming.  A lot of folks also have Netflix. Every time I check it out, I come away feeling like they don\\u0026rsquo;t have any of the shows or movies I would actually want to watch available for streaming. I hear if you like older shows and documentaries, it\\u0026rsquo;s a great service.\\nUpdate: A lot of people really love Netflix\\u0026rsquo;s original programming, too. I haven\\u0026rsquo;t ever seen it, so I can\\u0026rsquo;t comment.\\nInternet There are two things you can only get with a TV subscription: HBO and ESPN. Fortunately, I\\u0026rsquo;m not into sports, but I do love HBO. Comcast, Time Warner, and FiOS all offer internet packages that also include local stations and HBO Go.\\nUnfortunately, Comcast hasn\\u0026rsquo;t signed the required partnerships that would allow you to access HBO Go on devices like Roku and Apple TV, nor with Hulu to get earlier access to shows for channels you pay for as part of your cable subscription.\\nI went with FiOS because it was cheaper, faster, and let me watch HBO Go on all of my devices.\\n(Look for their internet + local channels package, but tell them you don\\u0026rsquo;t need the digital box.)\\nUpdate: You can now get HBO independent of cable with HBO Now.\\nRoku Roku is a tiny little box that let\\u0026rsquo;s you access internet content on your TV.\\nAlmost all of my computer devices are made by Apple, but I chose the Roku over the Apple TV. The primary reason: I buy most of my content from Amazon, which isn\\u0026rsquo;t avaiable on the Apple TV (technically it is, but it requires you to airplay from another device).\\nIf you get most of your content from iTunes, or if you\\u0026rsquo;re really into sports, Apple TV may be a better choice for you.\\nA digital antenna Unfortunately, CBS shows like Big Bang Theory are only available on broadcast television. Luckily, local network television stations still broadcast television over-the-air.\\nI purchased a Mohu Leaf 50. I live in the suburbs, so I needed something with good range and a signal amplifier. I mounted it in my attic, and pick up about 40-something stations.\\nGetting your antenna as high and close to an outside wall as possible is key. My antenna doubled the number of channels it got when I moved it three feet over.\\nTablo Tablo is a whole-house DVR for my digital antenna. It adds a TV guide layer to live television, and also allows you set recordings based on individual shows or entire series.\\nInstead of connecting to your TV with an HDMI cable, it streams content over your home wifi network to any connected device. This is awesome because it lets you put the Tablo where you get the best antenna reception instead of near where the TV is.\\nIt also means I can access my DVR content from any web-enabled device in the house on up to six devices at once. You can even configure it to let you access content from the road. Watching live TV and DVR recordings on your iPhone is awesome!\\nTablo does require a subscription, but they offer a lifetime option for just $150 that\\u0026rsquo;s tied to your account instead of the device. That means that if you ever upgrade or replace your Tablo, the subscription is still good.\\nA new router I had been using the same router since college\\u0026mdash;one of those blue Linksys B/G routers. I picked up a new Netgear AC router. It rocks for two reasons.\\n It broadcasts on multiple channels. Older routers used the 2.4ghz channel, which is also used by a lot of other devices (including baby monitors and microwaves), and therefore prone to interference. My new router also uses the 5ghz channel and provides a faster, better signal. Older routers broadcast their signal generally in all directions. While my new router also broadcasts a loose signal in all directions, once it connect to a device, it sends a stronger signal in its direction.  While most internet providers supply a two-in-one modem/router, the router usually isn\\u0026rsquo;t that good. I followed these instructions to put my moden into bridge mode and use my Netgear instead.\\nPlex This will be very unneccessary for most people, but I setup a Plex media server on an old computer we don\\u0026rsquo;t use much.\\nA few years ago, I digitized our old DVD collection. Plex lets me wirelessly access my movies\\u0026mdash;as well as my photos, music, and home videos\\u0026mdash;from any internet connected device in the house. Like the Tablo, you can restrict access to your local network, or configure it for access on-the-go.\\nThe result My cable-free setup has an up-front cost of about $500 in new electronics. But over the course of the year, I\\u0026rsquo;ll save $1,000 over what I was paying for cable.

Let\\u0026rsquo;s explore a few of the tasks you might want to achieve.\\nGetting the first match up the tree In jQuery, .closest() climbs up the DOM tree and finds the first element that has the selector you\\u0026rsquo;re trying to match against. It starts with the first element, and then climbs. Here\\u0026rsquo;s a vanilla JS method that does the same thing:\\n/** * Get the closest matching element up the DOM tree. * @private * @param {Element} elem Starting element * @param {String} selector Selector to match against * @return {Boolean|Element} Returns null if not match found */ var getClosest = function ( elem, selector ) { // Element.matches() polyfill \\tif (!Element.prototype.matches) { Element.prototype.matches = Element.prototype.matchesSelector || Element.prototype.mozMatchesSelector || Element.prototype.msMatchesSelector || Element.prototype.oMatchesSelector || Element.prototype.webkitMatchesSelector || function(s) { var matches = (this.document || this.ownerDocument).querySelectorAll(s), i = matches.length; while (--i \\u0026gt;= 0 \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; matches.item(i) !== this) {} return i \\u0026gt; -1; }; } // Get closest match \\tfor ( ; elem \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; elem !== document; elem = elem.parentNode ) { if ( elem.matches( selector ) ) return elem; } return null; };  And to use it:\\nvar elem = document.querySelector(\\u0026#39;#example\\u0026#39;); var closestElem = getClosest(elem, \\u0026#39;.sample-class\\u0026#39;);  If you wanted to start with the element\\u0026rsquo;s parent instead of the element itself (equivalent to the .parent() method), you would do this:\\nvar elem = document.querySelector(\\u0026#39;#example\\u0026#39;); var closestElem = getClosest(elem.parentNode, \\u0026#39;#sample-id\\u0026#39;);  Getting all matches up the tree In jQuery, .parents() climbs the DOM tree and returns all parent elements. If you include a selector, it will only return those that match. Here\\u0026rsquo;s the vanilla JavaScript equivalent:\\n/** * Get all of an element\\u0026#39;s parent elements up the DOM tree * @param {Node} elem The element * @param {String} selector Selector to match against [optional] * @return {Array} The parent elements */ var getParents = function ( elem, selector ) { // Element.matches() polyfill \\tif (!Element.prototype.matches) { Element.prototype.matches = Element.prototype.matchesSelector || Element.prototype.mozMatchesSelector || Element.prototype.msMatchesSelector || Element.prototype.oMatchesSelector || Element.prototype.webkitMatchesSelector || function(s) { var matches = (this.document || this.ownerDocument).querySelectorAll(s), i = matches.length; while (--i \\u0026gt;= 0 \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; matches.item(i) !== this) {} return i \\u0026gt; -1; }; } // Setup parents array \\tvar parents = []; // Get matching parent elements \\tfor ( ; elem \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; elem !== document; elem = elem.parentNode ) { // Add matching parents to array \\tif ( selector ) { if ( elem.matches( selector ) ) { parents.push( elem ); } } else { parents.push( elem ); } } return parents; };  And to use it:\\nvar elem = document.querySelector(\\u0026#39;#some-element\\u0026#39;); var parents = getParents(elem, \\u0026#39;.some-class\\u0026#39;); var allParents = getParents(elem.parentNode);  Once again, if you wanted to start with the element\\u0026rsquo;s parent instead of the element itself, you would do this:\\nvar elem = document.querySelector(\\u0026#39;#example\\u0026#39;); var parents = getClosest(elem.parentNode, \\u0026#39;[data-sample]\\u0026#39;);  Getting all matches up the tree until a matching parent is found In jQuery, .parentsUntil() climbs the DOM tree and returns all parent elements until a matching parent is found. If you include a selector, it will only return those that match. Here\\u0026rsquo;s the vanilla JavaScript equivalent:\\n/** * Get all of an element\\u0026#39;s parent elements up the DOM tree until a matching parent is found * @param {Node} elem The element * @param {String} parent The selector for the parent to stop at * @param {String} selector The selector to filter against [optionals] * @return {Array} The parent elements */ var getParentsUntil = function ( elem, parent, selector ) { // Element.matches() polyfill \\tif (!Element.prototype.matches) { Element.prototype.matches = Element.prototype.matchesSelector || Element.prototype.mozMatchesSelector || Element.prototype.msMatchesSelector || Element.prototype.oMatchesSelector || Element.prototype.webkitMatchesSelector || function(s) { var matches = (this.document || this.ownerDocument).querySelectorAll(s), i = matches.length; while (--i \\u0026gt;= 0 \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; matches.item(i) !== this) {} return i \\u0026gt; -1; }; } // Setup parents array \\tvar parents = []; // Get matching parent elements \\tfor ( ; elem \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; elem !== document; elem = elem.parentNode ) { if ( parent ) { if ( elem.matches( parent ) ) break; } if ( selector ) { if ( elem.matches( selector ) ) { parents.push( elem ); } break; } parents.push( elem ); } return parents; };  And to use it:\\nvar elem = document.querySelector(\\u0026#39;#some-element\\u0026#39;); var parentsUntil = getParentsUntil(elem, \\u0026#39;.some-class\\u0026#39;); var parentsUntilByFilter = getParentsUntil(elem, \\u0026#39;.some-class\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;[data-something]\\u0026#39;); var allParentsUntil = getParentsUntil(elem); var allParentsExcludingElem = getParentsUntil(elem.parentNode);  Climbing down the DOM tree In jQuery, the .find() method provides an easy way to match elements down the DOM tree by selector. In vanilla JS, climbing down the DOM tree is actually a lot easier than going up, and can be achieved with the querySelector family of web API\\u0026rsquo;s.\\nGetting the first match down the tree var elem = document.querySelector(\\u0026#39;#example\\u0026#39;); var firstElem = elem.querySelector(\\u0026#39;.sample-class\\u0026#39;);  Getting all matches down the tree var elem = document.querySelector(\\u0026#39;#example\\u0026#39;); var allElems = elem.querySelectorAll(\\u0026#39;[data-sample]\\u0026#39;);  Enjoy!\\n\",\"summary\":\"On a recent Javascript project, I needed to climb up the DOM tree looking for the first element that had a particular class, ID, or data attribute.\\nThis is really easy to do with jQuery, but today I wanted to share some simple vanilla JavaScript methods to duplicate jQuery\\u0026rsquo;s .closest(), .parent/s(), and .find() APIs.\\nNote: Updated on December 16, 2014, to include tag selectors.\\nClimbing up the DOM tree jQuery offers a few methods for climbing up the DOM tree.\",\"title\":\"Climbing up and down the DOM tree with vanilla JavaScript\",\"url\":\"https://gomakethings.com/climbing-up-and-down-the-dom-tree-with-vanilla-javascript/\"},{\"categories\":[\"Code\"],\"content\":\" This article details how I write modern, native JavaScript (aka vanilla JS), and includes a growing collection of native JavaScript equivalents for common jQuery tasks.\\nTable of Contents  Why go native?

One of the benefits of a framework like jQuery is that it smooths out all of the weird browser inconsistencies you might run into. But, all that abstraction and extra code adds a lot of weight and performance latency to a site.\\nTim Kadlec writes\\u0026hellip;\\n It’s not just download sizes that you should be worried about. In a presentation given at Velocity in 2011, Maximiliano Firtman pointed out that on some phones (older, but still popular, BlackBerry devices for example) can take up to 8 seconds just to parse jQuery. More recent research from Stoyan Stefanov revealed that even on iOS 5.1, it was taking as many as 200-300ms to parse jQuery.\\n And while I unfortunately don\\u0026rsquo;t have hard numbers to back it up, I have found that converting the sites I build over to native JavaScript has had a dramatic impact on site performance.\\nUpdate: Tim\\u0026rsquo;s got some updated data, and while modern iOS and Android devices are lightning fast, older models\\u0026mdash;including ones that are still on the market\\u0026mdash;performed much more poorly.\\nMy approach The web is for everyone, but support is not the same as optimization.\\nRather than trying to provide the same level of functionality for older browsers, I use progressive enhancement to serve a basic experience to all browsers (even Netscape and IE 5). Newer browsers that support modern APIs and techniques get the enhanced experience.\\nTo be clear, I’m not advocating dropping support for older and less capable browsers. They still have access to all of the content. They just don’t always get the same layout or extra features.\\nCutting the mustard I used a feature detection technique that the BBC calls “cutting the mustard.”\\nA simple browser test determines whether or not a browser supports modern JavaScript APIs. If it does, it gets the enhanced experience. If not, it gets a more basic one.\\nvar supports = !!document.querySelector \\u0026amp;\\u0026amp; !!window.addEventListener; if ( !supports ) return;  The !! converts the API method into a boolean value that you can test against. You can (and should) add all of the APIs you need to test against to this list.\\nThe !supports if statement stops running the script of the browser doesn\\u0026rsquo;t support the appropriate APIs.\\nWhat browsers are supported? To quote the BBC:\\n  IE9+ Firefox 3.5+ Opera 9+ (and probably further back) Safari 4+ Chrome 1+ (I think) iPhone and iPad iOS1+ Android phone and tablets 2.1+ Blackberry OS6+ Windows 7.5+ (new Mango version) Mobile Firefox (all the versions we tested) Opera Mobile (all the versions we tested)   Hiding content after the JS is loaded In my scripts, after the mustard test is run, I include this line which adds a class to the \\u0026lt;html\\u0026gt; element after the script is loaded.\\ndocument.documentElement.className += \\u0026#39; js-MyPlugin\\u0026#39;;  In my CSS, I can prefix styles with .js-MyPlugin to ensure that JS-specific styles are only applied in supported browsers after the required files have downloaded. This does result in some FOUT, but it\\u0026rsquo;s worth it to ensure that users can always access content.\\nNative JavaScript APIs Below is a growing list of native JavaScript equivalents of jQuery APIs. Unless otherwise noted, these provide support for IE9 and above.\\nQuick aside: Many modern web and ECMAScript 5 APIs were influenced by jQuery, and have made working on the web much easier. Thanks jQuery!\\nSelectors Native JavaScript HTML5 provides two APIs to select elements in the DOM. document.querySelector() gets the first matching element, while document.querySelectorAll() returns a node list of all matching elements.\\nAlso supported in IE8, but only for CSS 2.1 selectors.\\nvar firstClass = document.querySelector( \\u0026#39;.some-class\\u0026#39; ); var firstId = document.querySelector( \\u0026#39;#some-id\\u0026#39; ); var firstData = document.querySelector( \\u0026#39;[data-example]\\u0026#39; ); var allClasses = document.querySelectorAll( \\u0026#39;.some-class\\u0026#39; ); var allData = document.querySelectorAll( \\u0026#39;[data-example]\\u0026#39; );  Looping through objects Iterate over arrays, objects, and node lists. Supported all the way back to IE6.\\n// Arrays and node lists var elems = document.querySelectorAll( \\u0026#39;.some-class\\u0026#39; ); for ( var i = 0, len = elems.length; i \\u0026lt; len; i++ ) { console.log(i) // index  console.log(elems[i]) // object } // Objects var obj = { apple: \\u0026#39;yum\\u0026#39;, pie: 3.214, applePie: true }; for ( var prop in obj ) { if ( Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call( obj, prop ) ) { console.log( prop ); // key \\tconsole.log( obj[prop] ); // value \\t} }  Note: Todd Motto has created a simple helper method that\\u0026rsquo;s useful if you frequently loop over objects.\\nClass manipulation Add, remove, and check for classes. The classList API support starts with IE10, but a polyfill provides support back to IE8. You should always use it.\\nvar elem = document.querySelector( \\u0026#39;#some-element\\u0026#39; ); elem.classList.add( \\u0026#39;some-class\\u0026#39; ); // Add class elem.classList.remove( \\u0026#39;some-other-class\\u0026#39; ); // Remove class elem.classList.toggle( \\u0026#39;some-other-class\\u0026#39; ); // Add or remove class if ( elem.classList.contains( \\u0026#39;some-third-class\\u0026#39; ) ) { // Check for class \\tconsole.log( \\u0026#39;yep!\\u0026#39; ); }  Manipulate styles Get and set inline styles. This is supported all the way back to IE6.\\nvar elem = document.querySelector( \\u0026#39;#some-element\\u0026#39; ); var color = elem.style.color; // Get a CSS attribute elem.style.color = \\u0026#39;rebeccapurple\\u0026#39;; // Set a CSS attribute var height = elem.style.minHeight; // Get a CSS attribute elem.style.minHeight = \\u0026#39;200px\\u0026#39;; // Set a CSS attribute  Note: Not sure what the right property name is? I Google these all the time!\\nManipulate attributes Add, remove, and check for attributes.\\nvar elem = document.querySelector( \\u0026#39;#some-element\\u0026#39; ); elem.getAttribute( \\u0026#39;data-example\\u0026#39; ); // Get data attribute elem.setAttribute( \\u0026#39;data-example\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;Hello world\\u0026#39; ); // Set data attribute if ( elem.hasAttribute( \\u0026#39;data-example\\u0026#39; ) ) { // Check data attribute \\tconsole.log( \\u0026#39;yep!\\u0026#39; ); }  You can use these APIs to get and set all sorts of attributes\\u0026mdash;not just data attributes. However, there\\u0026rsquo;s usually an API you can call directly on the element, too.\\nvar elem = document.querySelector( \\u0026#39;#some-element\\u0026#39; ); // Set an ID elem.setAttribute( \\u0026#39;id\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;new-id\\u0026#39; ); elem.id = \\u0026#39;new-id\\u0026#39;; // Set width elem.setAttribute( \\u0026#39;width\\u0026#39;, \\u0026#39;200px\\u0026#39; ); elem.width = \\u0026#39;200px\\u0026#39;; // Get title var title = elem.getAttribute( \\u0026#39;title\\u0026#39; ); var titleToo = elem.title;  Event listeners Listen for clicks, hovers, and more.\\nvar elem = document.querySelector( \\u0026#39;.some-class\\u0026#39; ); elem.addEventListener( \\u0026#39;click\\u0026#39;, function( event ) { // Do stuff }, false);  Unlike jQuery, each event requires its own listener, but you can assign a function to a variable to keep your code more DRY.\\nvar elem = document.querySelector( \\u0026#39;.some-class\\u0026#39; ); var someFunction = function ( event ) { // Do stuff }; elem.addEventListener( \\u0026#39;click\\u0026#39;, someFunction, false ); elem.addEventListener( \\u0026#39;mouseover\\u0026#39;, someFunction, false );  And if you need to pass multiple variables into a function assigned to a variable, use the .bind() API. The first variable is the one assigned to this, and event is automatically passed in as the last variable.\\nvar elem = document.querySelector( \\u0026#39;.some-class\\u0026#39; ); var someFunction = function ( var1, var2, var3, event ) { // Do stuff } elem.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;click\\u0026#39;, someFunction.bind( null, var1, var2, var3 ), false); elem.addEventListener(\\u0026#39;mouseover\\u0026#39;, someFunction.bind( null, var1, var2, var3 ), false);  Note: .bind() was a late addition to ECMAScript 5, and some otherwise compliant browsers don\\u0026rsquo;t support it. You should include the polyfill if you use it.\\nWith named functions, you can also remove event listeners.\\nelem.removeEventListener( \\u0026#39;click\\u0026#39;, someFunction, false ); elem.removeEventListener( \\u0026#39;mouseover\\u0026#39;, someFunction, false );  If you need to apply the same event listener on multiple elements, you can loop through each element and add a listener. A better and more performant approach, though, is to listen for events on the entire document and filter just the elements you need.\\n/** * Function to filter what\\u0026#39;s clicked and run your functions * @param {Event} event The event */ var eventHandler = function ( event ) { // Get the clicked element \\tvar toggle = event.target; // If clicked element is the one you\\u0026#39;re looking for, run your methods \\tif ( toggle.hasAttribute( \\u0026#39;data-example\\u0026#39; ) || toggle.classList.contains( \\u0026#39;sample-class\\u0026#39; ) ) { event.preventDefault(); // Prevent default click event \\tsomeMethod( the, arguments, to, pass, into, method ); } }; // Listen for all click events on the document document.addEventListener( \\u0026#39;click\\u0026#39;, eventHandler, false );  Waiting until the DOM is ready Run JS methods after the DOM is ready. While modern browsers support the DOMContentReady event listener, code won\\u0026rsquo;t execute if it\\u0026rsquo;s called after the DOM is loaded (the event it\\u0026rsquo;s listening for has already happened). The ready() method provided below executes your scripts immediately if the DOM is ready, and waits until it is if it\\u0026rsquo;s not.\\nUnder readyState, interactive runs once the document is done but before all images and stylesheets have been downloaded. complete runs after that stuff is downloaded, too. I\\u0026rsquo;ve included both for completeness.\\n/** * Run event after DOM is ready * @param {Function} fn Callback function */ var ready = function ( fn ) { // Sanity check  if ( typeof fn !== \\u0026#39;function\\u0026#39; ) return; // If document is already loaded, run method  if ( document.readyState === \\u0026#39;interactive\\u0026#39; || document.readyState === \\u0026#39;complete\\u0026#39; ) { return fn(); } // Otherwise, wait until document is loaded  document.addEventListener( \\u0026#39;DOMContentLoaded\\u0026#39;, fn, false ); }; // Example ready(function() { // Do stuff... });  Manipulate height Get and set height. It\\u0026rsquo;s a lot trickier in native JS than it should be, because there are multiple APIs for getting height, and they all return slightly different measurements. The getHeight() method provided below returns the largest measurement. These are supported back to IE6.\\n/** * Get the height of an element * @param {Node} elem The element * @return {Number} The height */ var getHeight = function ( elem ) { return Math.max( elem.scrollHeight, elem.offsetHeight, elem.clientHeight ); }; var elem = document.querySelector( \\u0026#39;#some-element\\u0026#39; ); var height = getHeight( elem ); // Get height elem.style.height = \\u0026#39;200px\\u0026#39;; // Set height  Working with forms Get field types, input content and states. These are supported back to IE6.\\nvar form = document.querySelector( \\u0026#39;#some-form\\u0026#39; ); var input = document.querySelector( \\u0026#39;#some-input\\u0026#39; ); var forms = document.forms; // Get all forms on a page var formElems = form.elements; // Get all form elements var inputType = input.type.toLowerCase(); // Get input type and convert to lowercase (radio, checkbox, text, etc.) var inputValue = input.value; // Get input value var inputName = input.name; // Get input name var isChecked = input.checked; // Get the checked status of a checkbox or radio button var isDisabled = input.disabled; // Get input disabled status  HTML content Get and set HTML content.\\nvar elem = document.querySelector( \\u0026#39;#some-element\\u0026#39; ); var html = elem.innerHTML; // Get HTML elem.innerHTML = \\u0026#39;Hello world!\\u0026#39;; // Set HTML  Extend Merge two or more objects together. The jQuery $.extend() API merges the content of subsequent objects into the first one, overriding it\\u0026rsquo;s original values. The method provided below returns a new object instead, preserving all of the original objects and their properties. Supported back to IE6.\\n/** * Merge two or more objects.

The one exception: my current setup, which runs on average about 200ms slower.\\nAnalyzing the results While there was a lot of variation among different combinations, there were also a few high-level patterns that stood out.\\n While inlining my CSS (either entirely or just critical path) sometimes resulted in a moderately faster initial renders, it always resulted in notably slower subsequent views. There was no consistent advantage to inlining just my critical path CSS over the entire file, or vice-versa. All other factors being equal, SVG and icon fonts seem to be equally performant.  Personally, I\\u0026rsquo;d rather add an extra 100ms to an initial render to gain 300ms on all subsequent views. With that in mind, I don\\u0026rsquo;t think I\\u0026rsquo;ll be inlining my CSS or feature detects.\\nUPDATE: When to use critical path CSS Filament Group is a big advocate of using critical path CSS, and their post on it is what prompted me to run my tests. Scott Jehl from Filament commented on on this post:\\n We tend to see the biggest improvements in start render on sites with complex layouts, imagery.\\n That makes sense. This site is incredibly light weight, and inlining CSS and then also asynchronously downloading an external file may actually add more overhead than just linking to the CSS. On a site with a larger CSS file, I can imagine the critical path CSS approach being beneficial.\\nMy Setup My setup today:\\n External CSS file, in the \\u0026lt;head\\u0026gt;. External feature detects script, in the \\u0026lt;head\\u0026gt;. External JS file, in the footer. An icon font generated with IcoMoon. JS and CSS files minified and concatenated. No jQuery. All scripts are 100% native JavaScript. WordPress, cached hourly with Comet Cache.1 Expires headers for static content and gzipping, both configured in my .htaccess file. All images smushed with ImageOptim.  Going forward, I do plan to convert to SVGs. It\\u0026rsquo;s a true image format that gets around some of the weird rendering issues that can happen with icon fonts2 and has better native support for screen readers and fallbacks for non-supporting browsers3.\\nFootnotes  This site runs on a really cheap shared hosting. Comet Cache probably has a bigger impact on the site\\u0026rsquo;s performance than anything else I\\u0026rsquo;ve done. It costs $15, but it\\u0026rsquo;s worth every single penny. Even if you assign an icon to the Private Use Area section of unicode, browser vendors sometimes assign their own icons to those characters, which can result in unintentional characters being displayed. Screen reader and non-supporting browser fallback text is possible (and not all that difficult) with icon fonts, but it does require you to be aware of it and add an extra class and a little markup. SVGs, by contrast, have screen reader support and fallbacks built right in. \",\"summary\":\"This site is pretty fast already, but over the weekend, I made some adjustments to further improve it\\u0026rsquo;s performance.\\nThis article was supposed to be about the changes I made and how they made my site even faster.

And it includes Live Reload and an easy way to serve local sites to all devices on your wifi network.\\nBut for all of the great things that CodeKit does, there are a few key things it doesn\\u0026rsquo;t.\\nThe CodeKit Way Kind of like Apple, CodeKit has some opinions on how things should work and to an extent limits what you can do.\\nFor example, if I wanted to generate both expanded and minified versions of the same file, I can\\u0026rsquo;t do that. I can compile a minified and source mapped version, but that\\u0026rsquo;s not the same thing. It doesn\\u0026rsquo;t include unit testing or continuous integration.\\nFor both my open source projects and client work, I needed something a bit more powerful.\\nEnter Gulp.js Gulp is a JavaScript task running powered by Node.js. You give it a series of instructions, and it runs them. That\\u0026rsquo;s it.\\nWhat makes Gulp shine is that it\\u0026rsquo;s extendable. There are so many plugins and scripts available to let you do pretty much anything you want to do. My current setup:\\n Lints and concatenates JS files. Compiles Sass files and automatically adds vendor prefixes. Exports both minified and expanded JS and CSS files. Cleans up file directories. Adds a header with copyright info to the top of all JS and CSS files. Runs Jasmine unit tests and generates reports. Includes a .travis.yml file for continuous integration with Travis CI.  Of all the items on the list, the last two are the most important for me.\\nWith every build, Gulp runs my unit tests and reports any broken or failing modules. It also issues a coverage report that let\\u0026rsquo;s me know how much of my script is actually covered by the test. (For example, a passing test with only one module tested isn\\u0026rsquo;t very useful.)\\nTravis CI runs with every push and pull request, and let\\u0026rsquo;s me know if anything I\\u0026rsquo;ve done breaks the build. This is particularly useful for open source projects where others have contributed code.\\nWhy not Grunt? A few folks have asked me why I chose Gulp over Grunt, the original JS task runner. A few reasons:\\n The Grunt syntax is a bit more verbose. Gulp tasks are simple and easy to write. Unlike Grunt, it didn\\u0026rsquo;t make me feel like an idiot. Piping. Grunt runs each task independently (or so I\\u0026rsquo;m told). Gulp let\\u0026rsquo;s you string together tasks and outputs a single file at the end, resulting in much faster build times. I had a huge head start from Todd Motto, whose Gulp OSS kickstarted my boilerplate. I added Sass support, concatenation, and unit testing coverage reports, and borrowed some structure from Mark Goodyear and Big Bite Creative\\u0026rsquo;s boilerplate as well.  Getting Started Want to try Gulp with one of your projects? (Fair warning, it will involve using Terminal.)\\nFirst, head over to GitHub and download the boilerplate. Next, make sure you have these three pieces of software installed:\\n PhantomJS Node.js Gulp sudo npm install -g gulp  In terminal, switch over to the Gulp Boilerplate directory. On a Mac, type cd, add a space, and then drag-and-drop the folder into the terminal window and hit return. (No idea how that works on a PC, sorry!)\\nNext, type npm install and hit return to install all of the files. Finally, type gulp followed by enter to run Gulp for the first time. That\\u0026rsquo;s it!\\nAny time you make changes and want to update things, run gulp again.\\nFile structure, making changes, etc. This is very much a work-in-progress for me, so the file structure will be changing and new tasks will get added as I get more comfortable using it. As of the time of writing, all of my work goes into the src directory, and Gulp outputs stuff into the dist directory.\\nIf you decide to use Travis CI, be sure to sign up for an account, and update the links in the README.md file with your own info.\\n\",\"summary\":\"Last week, I finally got setup with gulp.js, the JavaScript task runner for web developers.

The plugin is still awesome, but there\\u0026rsquo;s a few things about that I wish were done differently.\\nLast week I switched to Markdown through Jetpack, and I highly recommend it.\\n\\nAbout Markdown on Save What makes Markdown on Save so awesome is that it uses the undocumented post_content_filtered database column to store your markdown. On save, it converts your content to HTML and saves it in the regular post_content field.\\nIf you ever remove the plugin, all of your content is already saved in regular HTML, right where it should be. And because it’s converted ahead of time, there’s no latency on the front-end like you might experience with some other plugins.\\nWhat always bugged me was that it required you to choose markdown as your writing format every single time. There was no way to make that the default, which is silly, because you can use markup in markdown. There\\u0026rsquo;s no downside to making it the default.\\nMarkdown on Save also hides the editor shortcuts, and only applies to posts, not comments.\\nMarkdown in Jetpack Jetpack, the uber-plugin from Automattic, includes an optional markdown extension. It works exactly the same way as Markdown on Save, so if you ever remove it, your left with valid HTML. You can also apply it to comments, which makes it a lot easier for visitors to share links, code and more.\\nThe one downside for me is Jetpack itself. Jetpack does a lot of stuff, and most of it is turned on by default. Many of the default features are, from my perspective, site bloat\\u0026mdash;stuff like social sharing buttons and script heavy graphic treatments.\\nI would prefer to see those off by default, or even better, as standalone plugins that you can install and uninstall via Jetpack.\\nJetpack also forces you to connect your site with WordPress.com, even if you\\u0026rsquo;re not going to use any features that make that require that to function. Why not make that a requirement only when needed?\\nAll that said, the plugin is worth it for markdown support alone. Check it out.\\n\",\"summary\":\"Back in September I wrote about the Markdown on Save plugin by Mark Jaquith.

A device-agnostic approach also takes into account infinite combinations of screen resolution, input method, browser capability, and connection speed.  One of the more interesting things about the unpredictability of the user\\u0026rsquo;s browser and device. Smart phones have beautiful, high resolution screens, but weaker processors than desktops and often less reliable bandwidth. Smart TVs have very standards-compliant browsers, but challenging and interesting user input methods. And devices like the Nintendo DS, e-ink Kindle, and more have functioning browsers that people can and do use to access websites, often with spotty at best JavaScript support, and in the case of the Kindle, no color.\\nBut this unpredictability is what makes the web such an exciting space to be working in today. It\\u0026rsquo;s everywhere, and if we embrace the medium and design specifically for it, you can do amazing things.\\nProgressive Enhancement Scott Jehl explains how progressive enhancement actually makes his job easier over at the Pastry Box:\\n I sometimes hear concerns from developers that building with PE will hold them back from innovating and “moving the web forward,” because it requires spending a lot of time making things work in old or obscure browsers that aren’t presumed to be common within their audiences. I find the opposite to be true. For us, building with Progressive Enhancement moves almost all of our development time and costs to newer browsers, not older ones.  I couldn\\u0026rsquo;t agree more.

And it\\u0026rsquo;s one of the most annoying things about CSS.\\nThe ultimate width of an object isn\\u0026rsquo;t just it\\u0026rsquo;s width (as you\\u0026rsquo;d expect), but it\\u0026rsquo;s width plus it\\u0026rsquo;s padding, margins, and border. Every time you adjust padding or add a border, you need to redo your math.\\nThe one exception to this rule, amazingly is Internet Explorer 6. In IE 6, the rendered width of an object is its width. Period.\\nIn CSS3, the box-sizing property causes elements to render width as the specified by the width value. Any padding or borders take away from space inside the element rather than add to its width.\\nUniversal Box-Sizing To make life easier, folks like Paul Irish and Chris Coyier recommend just applying the box-sizing property to everything like so:\\n*, *:before, *:after { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; -moz-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } I resisted this approach for a long time because I\\u0026rsquo;d heard (often) that the universal selector (*) was bad for performance.

What’s wrong with that, you may ask? Very simply put, there’s no way for you to check your work by seeing what you entered. Which turns out to be very useful when you’re forced to use a minimum amount of characters, some punctuation, and the birthdate of at least one French king for your password. So people often submit incorrect passwords and head into downward usability spirals.  The problem is even worse on mobile devices, where tiny buttons, fat thumbs, and a lack of tactile feedback make it even easier to type in the wrong thing.\\n\\nA Solution The recommended solution? Give users the option of hiding or showing their password as they type. That\\u0026rsquo;s what Luke does on his web and mobile app, Polar. Several others, including Microsoft, Amazon, and LinkedIn, have taken this approach as well.\\nThe team at Cloud Four wrote a handy little script for enabling this type of behavior. Unfortunately, it\\u0026rsquo;s dependent on jQuery and comes pre-styled. That\\u0026rsquo;s great if you want something plug-and-play, but it doesn\\u0026rsquo;t give you as much flexibility as a developer.\\nIntroducing X-Ray This is all a long winded way of introducing X-Ray, a framework-free, style-agnostic, progressively-enhanced script I wrote that lets users show and hide passwords.\\nYou can turn any button or link into a password visibility toggle by adding an .x-ray class to it. Data attributes let you set which password field to toggle, and whether the password should be hidden or visible by default. You can change the toggle text/graphics based on whether or not the password is visible, too.\\nModern HTML5 browsers get the enhanced experience, while older browsers receive a traditional field with a masked password.\\nDownload X-Ray on Github.\\n\",\"summary\":\"For the last few months, Luke Wroblewski has been advocating for more usable password fields:\\n Here’s how a typical password field works: you enter a character, it displays a “secure” response in the form of a \\u0026bull;.

This has me rethinking the way I\\u0026rsquo;ve approached progressive enhancement.\\n\\nHow I do progressive enhancement I use modern JavaScript API’s in my scripts that don’t work in older and less capable browsers.\\nWhen I write scripts that hide or manipulate content on a page, I make all content visible by default, and use a feature test to add a .js class to the \\u0026lt;body\\u0026gt; element. I only hide and manipulate content when that class is present, esnuring that no one is ever prevented from seeing the content. (Learn more about how I use feature tests.)\\nUnfortunately, this can cause FOUC.\\nFixing FOUC FOUC, or flashes of unstyled content, happen when markup is loaded before the styles of scripts that style it.\\nI load my scripts in the footer for better performance. Because no content is hidden or manipulated before those scripts load (progressive enhancement), visitors will often see the page build before them, with all of the drop-down navigation elements visible and tab content stacked on top of each other. Once the script loads, everything looks normal.\\nA simple way to avoid this is by putting the feature test up in the \\u0026lt;head\\u0026gt; element, which is what I now do on all of the sites that build. Since it loads before any of the markup is painted, there\\u0026rsquo;s no FOUC.\\nSo we\\u0026rsquo;re good, right? Well, not exactly\\u0026hellip;\\nFailure to Load The Zeldman quote at the beginning of this piece identifies a giant hole in this approach. If a browser supports the appropriate API\\u0026rsquo;s but fails to load a JS file, the content is hidden, but the script that would allow a user to manipulate and view it isn\\u0026rsquo;t there.\\nI\\u0026rsquo;ve encountered this countless times, especially on mobile devices where things just time out because they take too long. Not being able to view the content you want is a terribly frustrating user experience\\u0026mdash;one far worse than a momentary flash of unstyled content.\\nAs Jake Archibald says:\\n Progressive enhancement has never been about users who've turned JavaScript off, or least it wasn't for me... Basically, when an elevator fails, it's useless. When an escalator fails, it becomes stairs. We should be building escalators, not elevators.  On Building Escalators Unfotunately, it feels like progressive ehancement and FOUC are a bit at odds with each other. You could just load all of your scripts in the \\u0026lt;head\\u0026gt;, but then your left with flashes of no content, which is even worse.\\nFor now, I plan on updating all of my scripts to run the feature test as part of the JS file itself. It will introduce some FOUC, but if the file doesn\\u0026rsquo;t download, users can still access the content. If anyone can come up with a better solution\\u0026mdash;one that removes FOUC and ensures users always have access to the content\\u0026mdash;let me know!\\n\",\"summary\":\"In his recent post on web standards and progressive enhancement, Zeldman notes:\\n When a site like Facebook stops functioning when a script forgets to load, that is a failure of education and understanding on the part of those who created the site.

Major kudos go out to Jennifer Robbins, Christopher Schmitt, and Ari Stiles who organized the event.\\nSo what made this event so great?\\nLocation. Providence is an amazing, beautiful city. It\\u0026rsquo;s easily accessible from both Boston and New York, it has a great design and development community, and it\\u0026rsquo;s a lot more affordable than some of the larger cities are.\\nSize.

I never had to decide what talk I wanted to attend (or more often, who I didn\\u0026rsquo;t mind missing). Every attendee saw every talk.\\nAmazing Speakers. Artifact had an amazing collection of speakers. Some are part of the regular conference circuit. Others were new voices. It was the perfect mix. And just as important, all of the speakers were very accessible, and more than happy to continue discussions between sessions and at the after party.\\nLong Breaks. Breaks between sessions were around 30-minutes long. This provided some space to both digest the talk you had just seen and allow for extended discussions and networking.\\nGreat Food. The food was amazing. There was lots of it, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. There was a nice mix of healthy and delicious snacks. Coffee was bottomless. Yum!\\nAmbiance. Artifact was held at the Biltmore, which is gorgeous. The ballroom had so much character. The lighting and layout where perfect. Tables provided amble room, but were still close enough that they invited conversation.\\nNo Vendors. There were event sponsors, and some of the sponsor companies even had speakers at the event. But there wasn\\u0026rsquo;t a vendor expo or booths or anything like that to distract from learning and networking.\\nOn Building Things for the Web Artifact is a conference about the evolving process of making things for the web. Speakers talked about the changing roles of designers and developers (and how they\\u0026rsquo;re coming closer together), the new deliverables and artifacts that emerge from the process, and how the tools and techniques we use are shifting.\\nSome notable trends:\\n Designers are getting more involved in the development, and developers are getting more involved in the design. This is a great thing! Wireframes are becoming rough and ugly, and move quickly into an HTML prototype.  The role of tools like Photoshop is changing. Style has become separated from form a bit, and tools like Style Tiles and Style Prototypes are replacing high-fidelity comps. The digital style guide\\u0026mdash;what Dave Rupert calls tiny Boostraps for every client\\u0026mdash;are becoming an important deliverable that allows the client's in-house team to run with a project after you leave.

In part 2, we looked at how to build high performance websites. This article will explore some WordPress-specific techniques and plugins.\\n\\nMarkup Order Matters Where you place styles and scripts in your markup can make your site render faster. WordPress provides two functions for loading styles and scripts: wp_enqueue_style() and wp_enqueue_script().\\nwp_enqueue_style() loads your stylesheets in the header by default\\u0026mdash;which is where we want them\\u0026mdash;so you don\\u0026rsquo;t need to modify anything here. wp_enqueue_script() also loads scripts in the header, and we want them in the footer. Here\\u0026rsquo;s the full function:\\nwp_enqueue_script( $handle, $src, $deps, $ver, $in_footer ); That last argument tells WordPress whether or not to load the script in the footer. It\\u0026rsquo;s false by default. Set it to true.\\nMinify \\u0026amp; Concatenate Every HTTP request adds additional load time, so you should combine like files. Whitespace in your code can double (or more) the size of your files, so you should remove it.\\nIn WordPress, plugins make this a bit more challenging. Plugins can load multiple, unminified scripts and stylesheets. You can\\u0026rsquo;t go and manually concatenate and minify them, because every time you update your plugins, your changes will get wiped out.\\nFortunately, plugins also make this easier.\\nMinQueue is a fantastic plugin that will minify and concatenate scripts and styles that are loaded using the wpenqueue* functions. There are several other plugins that do this as well, but I\\u0026rsquo;ve found MinQueue is the best balance of features, control, and ease-of-use. It even includes cache busting by changing the concatenated file name when you update one of the included scripts or styles.\\nMinifying your HTML Minfying your markup would be an absurd task if you had to do it manually. Fortunately, there\\u0026rsquo;s a plugin that handles that for you. It even drops a handy little comment at the bottom of the markup telling you how much weight you\\u0026rsquo;ve saved. Check out HTML Minify on GitHub.\\nGoogle-Hosted jQuery HTML5 Boilerplate uses a smart implementation of Google\\u0026rsquo;s hosted version of jQuery that provides a local fallback if the Google CDN is unavailable:\\n\\u0026lt;script src=\\\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/script\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;script\\u0026gt;window.jQuery || document.write('\\u0026lt;script src=\\\"js/vendor/jquery-1.10.2.min.js\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;\\\\/script\\u0026gt;')\\u0026lt;/script\\u0026gt; In WordPress, though, you should be using wp_enqueue_script() to deregister the built-in version of jQuery and register and load Google\\u0026rsquo;s version.\\nI created a plugin (forked from some great code on GitHub) that replicates HTML5 Boilerplate\\u0026rsquo;s implementation the WordPress way: Google-Hosted jQuery.\\nBetter JPGs A JPG compression level of 70 is considered high-quality for the web. WordPress uses a 90 compression rate, which results in substantially bigger files. It also creates baseline JPGs instead of progressive ones.\\nImage Compress \\u0026amp; Sharpen is a plugin that let\\u0026rsquo;s you set your own compression rate, convert baseline JPGs to progressive ones, and if you need to, sharpen your compressed images so that they stay sharp.\\nIf you have a bunch of images you\\u0026rsquo;ve already uploaded and want to recompress them with your new settings, try using the Regenerate Thumbnails plugin.\\nAdaptive Images Adaptive images hold a lot of promise, but the solution needs to be future compatible and not require you overly complex markup. Photon is an extension for Automattic\\u0026rsquo;s JetPack plugin that intercepts image requests and serves resized versions adjusted to fit the user\\u0026rsquo;s screen.\\nIf you\\u0026rsquo;re comfortable with your images being hosted and served from WordPress.com, it\\u0026rsquo;s a great tool.\\nGzipping \\u0026amp; Expire Headers Enabling gzipping and setting expire headers requires you to modify your .htaccess file. If you\\u0026rsquo;ve never done it before, it can be a bit intimidating.\\nThis is what a typical WordPress .htaccess file looks like:\\n# BEGIN WordPress \\u0026lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c\\u0026gt; RewriteEngine On RewriteBase /your-site/ RewriteRule ^index\\\\.php$ - [L] RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteRule . /your-site/index.php [L] \\u0026lt;/IfModule\\u0026gt; # END WordPress  Add your changes after #END WordPress.\\nPrebuild Your Site Every time someone visits your site, WordPress needs to create an HTML document by compiling your templates and database content into markup. On inexpensive shared hosting, this can add a lot of latency. Third-party API\\u0026rsquo;s can slow things down even more.\\nOne of the easiest ways to fix this is by telling WordPress to prebuild the HTML documents ahead of time, a process known as cacheing.\\nThere are a handful of plugins that do this, but my favorite is Comet Cache. Most cacheing plugins have a ton of confusing settings. Just install QuickCache, switch it to \\u0026ldquo;on,\\u0026rdquo; and you\\u0026rsquo;re good to go. It prebuilds your entire site once an hour every seven days, but you can adjust it to happen more or less frequently.\\nUpdate: And it automatically updates the prebuilt files whenever you make changes or someone leaves a comment.\\nThe one downside to this is that new comments won\\u0026rsquo;t be seen by others until the next rebuild. The Quick Cache Comment Garbage Collector plugin fixes that by rebuilding just that post or page when a comment is submitted.\\nIn Summary  Use the wp_enqueue_style() and wp_enqueue_script() functions to control your markup order. Use MinQueue to minify and concatenate your scripts and styles across multiple plugins. Use Minify HTML to easily minify your markup. Use Google-Hosted jQuery to include Google's CDN of jQuery on your site the WordPress way. Image Compress \\u0026amp; Sharpen will create smaller, faster JPGs, and Regenerate Thumbnails will let you recompress images you've already uploaded. Photon makes it easy to serve adaptive images. Enable gzipping and set expire headers after the WordPress-specific code in your .htaccess file. Use WordPress Quick Cache and The Quick Cache Comment Garbage Collector plugin to dramatically improve server response times.  Working with WordPress can make performance a bit more challenging, but some great plugins and functions also make it easier to build high performance websites.\\n\",\"summary\":\"This is part 3 of Wicked Fast Websites, a three-part series that explores why web performance matters and what you can do about it.\\nWordPress is a powerful tool, and it brings with some unique performance challenges. In part 2, we looked at how to build high performance websites. This article will explore some WordPress-specific techniques and plugins.\\n\\n\",\"title\":\"High performance WordPress\",\"url\":\"https://gomakethings.com/high-performance-wordpress/\"},{\"categories\":[\"Code\",\"Design and UX\"],\"content\":\"This is part 2 of Wicked Fast Websites, a three-part series that explores why web performance matters and what you can do about it.\\nWe’re in the middle of a perfect storm. Websites are larger, devices are more varied and less predictable, and performance expectations are higher than ever. Today, you\\u0026rsquo;ll learn some simple tools and techniques you can use to build high performance websites.\\n\\nAn aside: Today\\u0026rsquo;s websites are five times bigger than in 2009. In fact, they\\u0026rsquo;ve gotten 20-percent bigger this year alone. One of the easiest ways to improve the performance of your websites is to put them on a diet.\\nMarkup Order Matters When a browser accesses a webpage, it immediately begins reading and rendering the content. When it comes across external files likes images and videos, it begins downloading them, two at a time. This is really useful, because if you have a really large file, it doesn\\u0026rsquo;t hold up the other files from being downloaded.\\nThere are two exceptions to this process:\\n CSS stops a browser from rendering content. Repaints are bad for performance, so the browser waits until it's finished downloading the styles before rendering any additional content. JavaScript stops all other downloads. Because JS often manipulates objects on the page, the browser doesn't want to download them until it knows exactly what the JS is going to do.  Put your CSS at the top of your page, up in the \\u0026lt;head\\u0026gt; element, to avoid repaints. Similarly, put your JavaScript files down in the footer of your site to maximize concurrent downloads. The exception to this is feature detection and polyfill scripts (like Modernizr or an HTML shim), which should go in the \\u0026lt;head\\u0026gt; because your stylesheet often relies on them.\\nThe order of styles and scripts in your markup doesn\\u0026rsquo;t make the page download content any faster, but it does help browsers start displaying it more quickly, and therefore appear faster.\\nCombine Similar Files One of the biggest bottlenecks in page load time is in downloading the actual files for your site. Each HTTP request adds additional load time. How much time? According to Google:\\n Every time a client sends an HTTP request, it has to send all associated cookies that have been set for that domain and path along with it. Most users have asymmetric Internet connections: upload-to-download bandwidth ratios are commonly in the range of 1:4 to 1:20. This means that a 500-byte HTTP header request could take the equivalent time to upload as 10 KB of HTTP response data takes to download. The factor is actually even higher because HTTP request headers are sent uncompressed. In other words, for requests for small objects (say, less than 10 KB, the typical size of a compressed image), the data sent in a request header can account for the majority of the response time.  It\\u0026rsquo;s actually faster for a browser to download one 300kb file than it is to download three 100kb files. By combining similar file types together\\u0026mdash;a process known as concatenation\\u0026mdash;you can improve page performance.\\nWhen you can, combine all of your JavaScript into a single scripts.js file. Rather than loading separate CSS files for your base styles, small screens, bigger screens and so on, combine them all into a single stylesheet with media queries.\\nAnd don\\u0026rsquo;t think you can cheat by using the @import rule. That still requires additional HTTP requests.\\nRemove the Whitespace Minification is the process of removing spaces, line breaks and comments from your CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Though it might not seem like a big deal, removing all those unused elements can decrease the size of your files by 40-percent or more.\\nOne useful minification tool is Google PageSpeed Insights, a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox.\\nMinify Your CSS, JavaScript, \\u0026amp; HTML In your browser, open up Developer Tools and click on the “Page Speed” tab. Then click “Analyze.” You\\u0026rsquo;ll be given a list of things you can do to improve your site performance.\\nOne of the items on the list will be “Minify CSS.” Click it. Under “Suggestions for this page” is a link to “see optimized content.” Follow that to get a minified version of your CSS provided by Google.\\nThe result is a tiny but rather unreadable stylesheet. Rather than overwriting your human-readable CSS, paste the minified code into a new file called style.min.css and reference that in the header of your HTML. If you ever want to make updates, is as simple as removing the .min and reminifying when you\\u0026rsquo;re done.\\nPageSpeed Insights provides similar links for your JavaScript and markup as well. Like with my CSS, I\\u0026rsquo;ll keep a human-readable scripts.js file, and put my minified code in scripts.min.js. Minifying your markup gets a bit trickier, and results in less reduction in file weight, so you may choose not to follow that step.\\nMinify jQuery If you\\u0026rsquo;re using jQuery on your site, Google provides a hosted and minified version that\\u0026rsquo;s 34-percent of the original size. An additional benefit of using the Google-hosted version of that a lot of developers use this technique, so there\\u0026rsquo;s a good chance your visitor has jQuery cached in the browser already and doesn\\u0026rsquo;t need to download it at all.\\nHTML5 Boilerplate uses a smart implementation of this that provides a local fallback if the Google CDN is unavailable:\\n\\u0026lt;script src=\\\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/script\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;script\\u0026gt;window.jQuery || document.write('\\u0026lt;script src=\\\"js/vendor/jquery-1.10.2.min.js\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;\\\\/script\\u0026gt;')\\u0026lt;/script\\u0026gt; You\\u0026rsquo;ll notice that the http: is missing from the the URL. That helps avoid errors associated with encrypted domains.\\nSmarter Image Formats Different image formats work better for different types of graphics.\\nPNG is a lossless image format, so it keeps graphics sharp and crisp (as opposed to the lossy JPG format). For icons and simple images with clean lines, they can actually be more lightweight than JPGs. But for photos and images with lots of visual noise, JPGs will be much smaller in size with comparable quality.\\nJPG Formats The JPG actually has multiple formats. The most common on the web is the baseline JPG. Baseline JPGs start rendering at the top, and build down as they go.\\nPhoto by Tony Luong\\nAn alternative format that was popular a decade ago and is seeing a bit of a comeback is the progressive JPG. Progressive JPGs build in layers. Initially, the full image in low resolution is displayed, and as the image renders, it becomes increasingly crisp and clear.\\nWhile progressive JPGs are typically a little smaller than baseline, their real advantage is that they appear faster to the user because they display more content faster. And on smaller screens, the lack of clarity on initial renders may not even be as noticeable.\\nSource: Performance Calendar\\nWhile all browsers display progressive JPGs, some browsers do a better job than others. For \\u0026ldquo;non-supporting\\u0026rdquo; browsers, the entire progressive JPG needs to download before it can be displayed, resulting in a worse experience than a baseline JPG.\\nCompress Your JPGs Photos can add a lot of weight. A high-quality photo can weigh as much as 700kb or more. By compressing photos, you can reduce them down to less 100kb while maintaining image quality.\\nA JPG compression rate of 70 is considered high-quality for the web.\\nSmush Your Images The metadata that photographs include\\u0026mdash;timestamps, color profiles, and such\\u0026mdash;can add quite a bit of weight. Smushing is the process of removing that metadata, and it can reduce the size of an image by more than 25-percent.\\nIf you\\u0026rsquo;re a Mac user, ImageOptim will smush your images without degrading the quality. It works for PNGs, JPGs, and GIFs. Windows lacks a clear one-for-one counterpart, though their are a handful of products that work well for different image types. If you\\u0026rsquo;re a Windows user, check out b64.io, a web-based, drag-and-drop optimizer that seems to work just as well as ImageOptim (hat tip to Chris Coyier).\\nIcon Fonts Icon fonts take advantage of the CSS3 @font-face rule, and allow you to embed a font (kind of like webdings) on your site that contains all of your icons.\\nThey offer a few advantages over image-based icons:\\n They're lightweight. All of your icons are in a single file. They're styleable with CSS. Because they're a font, they're infinitely scalable, and look crisp on both regular and high-density displays. They're compatible all the way back to IE 5 (seriously).  There are two small considerations:\\n Windows Phone 7 (running IE 9) lacks true @font-face support. Icons can only be one color.  The free IcoMoon app allows you to pick just the icons you need and even upload your own. There\\u0026rsquo;s a lot to learn about icon fonts, so if you\\u0026rsquo;re interested, check out my start-to-finish tutorial on using them.\\nImage Sprites If you still need to serve up small sets of images, you should consider using image sprites. Rather than using multiple image files, you can combine all of your images into a single file and embed it using the background-image property, resulting in fewer HTTP requests.\\nImage sprites are useful if you need multi-color icons or Windows Phone 7 support, though their are some challenges in using them with high-density displays. They\\u0026rsquo;re also a bit harder to maintain should you decide to add or remove an icon. If you\\u0026rsquo;d like to use image sprites, the CSS Sprite Generator makes things a bit easier.\\nAdaptive Images Web images need to look good on everything from low-powered phones and watches to big-screen TVs and high-density displays. But why should a smartphone get the same image as a big, high-density monitor?\\nAdaptive images are an approach to this challenge. By detecting the size of the display (and ideally bandwidth constraints), you can serve the right image size for the device. Unfortunately, there\\u0026rsquo;s no great way to do this today, though there are a lot of people who are working on it.\\nMany of today\\u0026rsquo;s workarounds use JavaScript image-replacement. These scripts often load after images have already been downloaded, however, so the image gets downloaded twice, which is worse for performance than not doing anything at all. Matt Wilcox has created a PHP-based solution that intercepts the image request on the server. It works really well, but is a bit complicated to set up.\\nI believe the most promising solution lies with a standards-based solution (the W3C has several in the works) that let\\u0026rsquo;s the web developer offer the same images in multiple sizes, and let\\u0026rsquo;s the browser decide which one best fits the user\\u0026rsquo;s current needs.\\nCompress Your Site Your server can actually compress your website files\\u0026mdash;a process known as gzipping\\u0026mdash;before sending them to the browser. This results in about a 70-percent reduction in website size.\\nOn Apache servers, you can enable gzipping with a simple modification to your .htaccess file. Learn how in this tutorial on GitHub.\\nSome web hosts use a slightly different method to implement gzipping. You can check if it\\u0026rsquo;s working on your site using gzipWTF.\\nSet Expire Headers Expire headers tell browsers to keep static assets stored locally so that a visitor’s browser doesn’t have to re-download them every time they visit your site.\\nThis is also something that\\u0026rsquo;s done using the .htaccess file. To set expire headers, follow these instructions on GitHub.\\nIn Summary  Markup order matters. Combine similar files. Remove the whitespace. Use smarter image formats. Compress your JPGs. Smush your images. Use icon fonts and image sprites. Consider adding adaptive images. Compress your site. Set expire headers.  These techniques can be implemented in about an hour, and make a big difference on site performance. You can test your site performance using the Pingdom Website Speed Test.\\n\",\"summary\":\"This is part 2 of Wicked Fast Websites, a three-part series that explores why web performance matters and what you can do about it.\\nWe’re in the middle of a perfect storm.

I\\u0026rsquo;m sure you\\u0026rsquo;ve experienced this before. You\\u0026rsquo;re sitting on the couch, comfortable, when you realize you want to look something up. Rather than getting up and walking to whatever room you keep your laptop in, you just pull out the computer you always have with you\\u0026mdash;your phone\\u0026mdash;and Google it.\\nHarvard Business Review reported that 55-percent of Americans accessed the internet via a mobile device in 2012.

Separate navigation menus for logged-in and logged-out users. User access settings, so you can selectively hide content from logged-out (or logged-in) users. Security settings let you set password requirements, hide the admin bar, and block backend access. The web app settings panel lets you easily configure error messages, button text, and more.  So what's new in version 3? Now a Plugin WordPress for Web Apps has historically been a collection of templates and functions that you would include in your theme. In version 3, it\\u0026rsquo;s now a plugin.\\nMy thinking on plugins versus theme-specific functions has evolved a lot over the last month. This is a direct reaction to my belief that data and functionality should be persistent even when themes change.\\nBetter UX Some of the WordPress defaults for account creation and management don\\u0026rsquo;t provide the greatest user experience.\\nLogins By default, WordPress only allows users to login with their username. WordPress for Web Apps let\\u0026rsquo;s users also use their email address, so if they forget their username, they can still access the app.\\nSignups The old signup process required users to choose a username and provide an email address. WordPress then generated a password for them and emailed it in plain text. Not only does that add friction to the signup process, but it\\u0026rsquo;s not terribly good for security, either.\\nWordPress for Web Apps 3 let\\u0026rsquo;s users pick their own password, and then immediately logs them into the app.\\nPassword Resets When a user forgets their password, the old toolkit would send them an email with a link. When users clicked the link, it generated a new password and emailed it to them\\u0026mdash;again in plain text.\\nIn WordPress for Web Apps 3, users still get a reset email, but when they click it, they get to choose their own new password, and after saving their changes, their immediately logged in. Password reset URLs are unique to the user, and only good for 24 hours by default. After a password is reset, the link becomes invalid so it can\\u0026rsquo;t be used again by someone else to hack into an account.\\nThis all makes for a more secure app and a better user experience.\\nWeb App Settings Developers no longer have to dig through lines of code to make simple updates. WordPress for Web Apps 3 has a settings page you can use to control most of the essentials.\\nIf you don\\u0026rsquo;t want to mess around with settings, that\\u0026rsquo;s ok. WordPress for Web Apps includes a bunch of smart defaults so you don\\u0026rsquo;t have to.\\nBut if you want more control, you\\u0026rsquo;ve got it. The \\u0026ldquo;Web App Options\\u0026rdquo; page in the admin dashboard makes it easy to customize and control password requirements, button text and styling, alert messages and more.\\nThis was as much a change for me as it was for others. Digging through code to change a simple alert message is a pain.\\nNavigation The old toolkit required developers to add code to their theme template files to serve different navigation elements to logged-in and logged-out users. WordPress for Web Apps 3 hooks into the wp_nav_menu() function so that you can create unique navigation menus from the Admin dashboard.\\nIt also let\\u0026rsquo;s you use simple shortcodes to display the current user\\u0026rsquo;s username and provide logged-in users with a logout link.\\nTheming Like most of the add-ons for Kraken, WordPress for Web Apps 3 is style agnostic. Forms, links and buttons will pick up your default theme styles, so you don\\u0026rsquo;t have to waste time removing or overriding someone else\\u0026rsquo;s design choices.\\nYou can add classes to buttons and alerts in the settings, and each form has a .form-wpwebapp class on it that you can hook into for more specific styling if needed. And if you know your way around code, you can still dig into the plugin and make some additional changes.\\nSecurity \\u0026amp; Code The previous versions of WordPress for Web Apps included a lot of code that I had cobbled together from blogs and Stack Overflow threads.\\nThe forms used inconsistent markup and different validation methods. There was redundancy in a lot of the code, and even a few deprecated functions. And for a few folks, if the forms were included before the loop, they wouldn\\u0026rsquo;t work properly.\\nIn version 3, I\\u0026rsquo;ve rewritten all of the code from scratch. It includes the latest functions and methods, including a security check to make sure form requests are originated from your site and not somewhere else. All of the form inputs are validated before going into the database, and properly escaped before being displayed on the site. And, everything is translation ready for easy internationalization.\\nWhat's next? In the next iteration of this plugin, I plan to:\\n Let admin customize \\\"password reset\\\" and \\\"welcome message\\\" emails in the settings panel. Add a front-end \\\"Delete Account\\\" button. Add \\\"Update Profile\\\" options for front-end for users. Add an option to restrict signups to only selected email addresses (for private sites or betas). Add Gravatar shortcode for user profiles. Add an option to set default user access for pages (currently defaults to all users).  All-in-all, I think WordPress for Web Apps 3 is a huge leap forward over the old version. Check it out for your next project, and if you\\u0026rsquo;ve used older versions, you might want to consider upgrading.\\nDownload it on Github\\n\",\"summary\":\"I just released WordPress for Web Apps 3.\\nWordPress for Web Apps provides the essential components you need to power your web app with WordPress:\\n Front-end login, sign-up, password reset, and password change forms.

Two Approaches to Development There are two ways to add custom functionality to WordPress.\\n The functions.php file. Plugins.  Both have their advantages and disadvantages.\\nfunctions.php Up to this point, this has been my preferred approach.\\nTo keep things modular, each function has it\\u0026rsquo;s own file. I activate the functions by requiring them in the functions.php file:\\nrequire_once( get_template_directory() . 'file-name.php' ); I develop locally using MAMP. By including all of my custom functions in the functions.php file, all I need to do is upload the theme to the server when I\\u0026rsquo;m ready to go live.\\nSo why would I want to use plugins instead?\\nPlugins Plugins provide portability. Because they\\u0026rsquo;re separate from the theme, the functionality remains even when the theme changes.\\nIf you\\u0026rsquo;re building a web app, you want a front-end login screen and sign-up form not matter what theme you\\u0026rsquo;re using. If you\\u0026rsquo;re an animal rescue, you always want to display a list of your dogs.\\nPutting those in functions.php requires you add them to whatever theme you choose. Keeping the functionality in a plugin means you can swap themes freely.\\nSo plugins are the obvious solution, right?\\nFunctions or Plugins? If you\\u0026rsquo;re including a lot of custom functionality (and develop locally), plugins can make the deployment process a fair bit more cumbersome.\\nThey\\u0026rsquo;re also a potential breaking point for your client. What happens if they inadvertently deactivate or remove a plugin? And if you or your client do switch themes, the content will remain, but the styling may be very incompatible with your new theme.\\nBuilt for Developers These aren\\u0026rsquo;t plug-and-play solutions. They\\u0026rsquo;re intended for people who want to dig into the code and build custom solutions for themselves and their clients.\\nIf you\\u0026rsquo;re the type of person (or client) who\\u0026rsquo;s investing in custom development, you\\u0026rsquo;re probably not going to be switching out themes every year with something from the WordPress theme gallery. And any decent developer should know how to port over a few custom functions\\u0026mdash;especially ones that are in their own folder as modular, clearly documented files.\\nWhat do you think? I was really on the fence with this one.\\nPlugins help ensure data portability, which I think is really important. But they\\u0026rsquo;re also more work for both us as developers and for our clients from a cognitive load perspective.\\nBut when I consider how data is stored and managed, and how to be as future-friendly as possible, the answer is clear: plugins for any data or features that should exist beyond the current theme.\\nThat\\u0026rsquo;s my perspective, anyways.

Modernizr is a great tool for this, but today, I want to show you how you can write your own simple feature tests.\\nWhat a feature test looks like At it\\u0026rsquo;s core, a feature test is a simple if statement:\\nif ( support for feature exists ) { // Do something } I use feature tests in two ways:\\n I'll add classes to the document to activate certain styles in my CSS file. I'll wrap them around my JavaScript to ensure the browser can handle the API's used.  Let\\u0026rsquo;s look at some examples.\\nChecking for modern JavaScript support I use modern JavaScript API\\u0026rsquo;s in my scripts that don\\u0026rsquo;t work in older and less capable browsers. These API\\u0026rsquo;s include query selectors, event listeners, and foreach loops. Here\\u0026rsquo;s the if statement I use:\\nif ( 'querySelector' in document \\u0026\\u0026 'addEventListener' in window \\u0026\\u0026 Array.prototype.forEach ) { // Do stuff... } Some of my scripts use CSS to hide and show elements. By default, I want all elements visible. They should only be hidden if the browser has the appropriate JavaScript support to make them visible. To do that, I include this script:\\nif ( 'querySelector' in document \\u0026\\u0026 'addEventListener' in window \\u0026\\u0026 Array.prototype.forEach ) { document.documentElement.className += 'js'; } That adds a .js class to the \\u0026lt;html\\u0026gt; element. In my CSS, I\\u0026rsquo;ll include something like this:\\n.js .example { display: none; visibility: hidden; } Now, elements with the .example class are only hidden when the appropriate API\\u0026rsquo;s are supported.\\nI also don\\u0026rsquo;t want to run scripts that use unsupported API\\u0026rsquo;s, as that can result in errors and weird layout quirks. I\\u0026rsquo;ll wrap a feature test around my script like this:\\nif ( 'querySelector' in document \\u0026\\u0026 'addEventListener' in window \\u0026\\u0026 Array.prototype.forEach ) { // My scripts go here... } Checking for @font-face support I love using icon fonts, but certain browsers (notably Opera Mini and IE 9 on Windows Phone 7) don\\u0026rsquo;t support font embedding. I also use the :before pseudo selector to include icons in my HTML.\\nFor browsers that don\\u0026rsquo;t support either of those, users will see empty squares where the icons should be. I\\u0026rsquo;d rather they see nothing at all, or in some cases, see text instead. Paul Irish and Diego Perini shared two little functions that check for support of these features.\\nI include these functions in my JS file, and then use this if statement:\\nif (isFontFaceSupported \\u0026\\u0026 selectorSupported(':before')) { document.documentElement.className += 'font-face'; } Then in my stylesheet, I make sure that I prefix my @font-face styles with .font-face.\\nIncluding a feature test on your site So you\\u0026rsquo;ve written your feature test. Now where do you put it?\\nTests that I wrap around scripts go in my main JavaScript file. Feature tests that add a class to the document go in their own file that I usually name feature-test.js. While most of my JS files go in the footer for better performance, I want the test to run as quickly as possible to avoid \\u0026ldquo;flashes of unstyled content\\u0026rdquo; (or FOUC, as it\\u0026rsquo;s sometimes called).\\nI include the feature-test.js in the \\u0026lt;head\\u0026gt; element:\\n\\u0026lt;script src=\\\"feature-test.js\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/script\\u0026gt; How do you know what to check for? Google is a great place to start. A lot of the conditional statements can be found on the Mozilla Developer Network, where they\\u0026rsquo;re included as part of the polyfill recommendations.

Because it does a lot of things, it\\u0026rsquo;s pretty big (the minified version weighs in at 93kb). And because of all the abstraction it does, it\\u0026rsquo;s also a lot slower.\\nMicro-frameworks are like super tiny versions of jQuery. They\\u0026rsquo;re lightweight, focused and fast. By writing your own, you can include only what you need and nothing that you don\\u0026rsquo;t.\\nWhat goes in a micro-framework? What you include in your micro-framework will vary by project.\\nEvery project I\\u0026rsquo;ve done so far has include some simple class handlers - functions to add, remove and toggle classes, as well as check to see if an object has a class in the first place. For Drop, my simple dropdown menu script, I used a function to get all siblings of an object.\\nYou can find an assortment of mini helper functions on Microjs, StackOverflow, and GitHub.\\nUpdate on August 26, 2013 - Check out Buoy, the simple micro-library I\\u0026rsquo;m now using with all my projects.\\nA micro-framework in action Let\\u0026rsquo;s say I wanted to check to see if an element has the .sandwich class. If it does, we\\u0026rsquo;ll remove it. If it doesn\\u0026rsquo;t, we\\u0026rsquo;ll add.\\nIn my JavaScript file, I\\u0026rsquo;ll put my micro-framework helper functions up at the top:\\n// Check if an element has a class var hasClass = function (elem, className) { return new RegExp(' ' + className + ' ').test(' ' + elem.className + ' '); } // Add a class to an element var addClass = function (elem, className) { if (!hasClass(elem, className)) { elem.className += ' ' + className; } } // Remove a class from an element var removeClass = function (elem, className) { var newClass = ' ' + elem.className.replace( /[\\\\t\\\\r\\\\n]/g, ' ') + ' '; if (hasClass(elem, className)) { while (newClass.indexOf(' ' + className + ' ') = 0 ) { newClass = newClass.replace(' ' + className + ' ', ' '); } elem.className = newClass.replace(/^\\\\s+|\\\\s+$/g, ''); } } // Toggle a class on an element var toggleClass = function (elem, className) { if ( hasClass(elem, className) ) { removeClass(elem, className); } else { addClass(elem, className); } } Then use them in my code:\\nvar turkeySandwich = document.querySelector('#turkey'); toggleClass(turkeySandwich, 'sandwich'); Total file size?

Today, I want to share the process for going framework-free.\\nDifferent browsers. Different features. One of the benefits of a framework like jQuery is that it smooths out all of the weird browser inconsistencies you might run into. But, all that abstraction and extra code adds a lot of weight and performance latency to a site.\\nRather than trying to provide the same level of functionality for older browsers, I took a progressive enhancement approach to development. Older and less capable browsers get a basic experience. Newer browsers that support modern APIs get an enhanced one.\\nTo be clear, I\\u0026rsquo;m not advocating dropping support for older and less capable browsers. They still have access to all of the content. They just don\\u0026rsquo;t always get the same layout or extra features.\\nCutting the Mustard I used a simple feature detection technique coined by the BBC as \\u0026ldquo;cutting the mustard.\\u0026rdquo; This one \\u0026ldquo;if statement\\u0026rdquo; tests support for modern JavaScript APIs:\\nif ( 'querySelector' in document \\u0026\\u0026 'addEventListener' in window ) { // Scripts go here } The BBC explains why these were chosen:\\ndocument.querySelector - A large part of any JS library is its DOM selector. If the browser has native CSS selecting then it removes the need for a DOM selector. QuerySelector has been available in Firefox since 3.5 at least and has been working in webkit for ages. It also works in IE9. ... window.addEventListener - Another large part of any JS library is event support. Every browser made in the last 6 years (except IE8) supports DOM level 2 events. If the browser supports this then we know it has better standards support than IE8. The BBC also tests for local storage support, but since none of my scripts use that at this time, I left it out. I did, however, add a check for forEach loops, which are a newer API that I use often.\\nNote: This section was updated on August 16, 2013 to include forEach loops as part of the \\u0026ldquo;cut the mustard\\u0026rdquo; test, and again on August 20, 2014 to include a better approach.\\nSo what browsers does that support? The \\u0026ldquo;cut the mustard\\u0026rdquo; test splits browsers into two categories: HTML5 browsers, and not-HTML5 browsers. From the BBC, here\\u0026rsquo;s how common browsers get split up:\\nHTML5 browsers:  IE9+ Firefox 3.5+ Opera 9+ (and probably further back) Safari 4+ Chrome 1+ (I think) iPhone and iPad iOS1+ Android phone and tablets 2.1+ Blackberry OS6+ Windows 7.5+ (new Mango version) Mobile Firefox (all the versions we tested) Opera Mobile (all the versions we tested)  HTML4 browsers:  IE8 Blackberry OS5 Nokia S60 v6 Nokia S40 (all versions) All other Symbian variants Windows 7 phone (pre-Mango) …and many more that are too numerous to mention  Bootstrapping in your code Up in the document \\u0026lt;head\\u0026gt;, I include this little snippet of code:\\nif ( 'querySelector' in document \\u0026\\u0026 'addEventListener' in window ) { document.documentElement.className += 'js'; } This does the mustard test, and if the browser passes, adds a .js class to the \\u0026lt;html\\u0026gt; element.\\nIf any of my scripts also rely on CSS, I make them conditional on the presence of that class. That way, nothing is ever hidden or inaccessible for someone whose browser doesn\\u0026rsquo;t pass the test.\\nBy putting that script in the head, before the content has even loaded, you ensure that users with modern browsers don\\u0026rsquo;t see any weird style changes after the page loads.\\nIn my JavaScript file (yes, just one), I use the same mustard test as a wrapper for my scripts:\\nif ( 'querySelector' in document \\u0026\\u0026 'addEventListener' in window ) { // Scripts go here } Working with selectors Modern JavaScript APIs make working with selectors a lot easier.\\nFor getting objects by ID, I use querySelector. For example, if I wanted to get a div with the ID of #turkey, I\\u0026rsquo;d do this:\\nvar sandwichTurkey = document.querySelector('#turkey'); If you\\u0026rsquo;ve never used querySelector before, it returns the first element on a page that matches the selector. For IDs, there should only be one match per page. For classes, it would return the first element with that class.\\nTo get all objects with a particular class, I use querySelectorAll. For example, to get all elements with the .sandwich class, I\\u0026rsquo;d do this:\\nvar sandwiches = document.querySelectorAll('.sandwich'); It returns an array of elements a node list that I can loop through and work with.\\nLooping through elements If you get all elements with a particular class, you most likely want to do something with them. Doing so is easy with a for loop:\\nvar sandwiches = document.querySelectorAll('.sandwich'); for (var i = 0, len = sandwiches.length; i  Event listeners Taking action when someone clicks, uses their keyboard, and more is pretty easy thanks to the addEventListener method.\\nIf I wanted to do something whenever anyone clicked a link with the #turkey ID, I\\u0026rsquo;d use this script:\\nvar sandwichTurkey = querySelector('#turkey'); sandwichTurkey.addEventListener('click', function(e) { // Do stuff }, false); Working with classes One of awesome new JavaScript methods is classList, that let\\u0026rsquo;s you easily add, remove and toggle classes just like you would in jQuery. Unfortunately, it still lacks the browser support it needs for every day use.\\nUpdate on June 9, 2014: I\\u0026rsquo;m now including Eli Grey\\u0026rsquo;s classList.js polyfill in my projects. It extends support back to IE 8, and when classList support is good enough, I can just remove the polyfill from my projects without updating any of my code.\\nIn the interim, Todd Motto has created some awesome class handler functions that I include in every project:\\nvar hasClass = function (elem, className) { return new RegExp(' ' + className + ' ').test(' ' + elem.className + ' '); } var addClass = function (elem, className) { if (!hasClass(elem, className)) { elem.className += ' ' + className; } } var removeClass = function (elem, className) { var newClass = ' ' + elem.className.replace( /[\\\\t\\\\r\\\\n]/g, ' ') + ' '; if (hasClass(elem, className)) { while (newClass.indexOf(' ' + className + ' ') = 0 ) { newClass = newClass.replace(' ' + className + ' ', ' '); } elem.className = newClass.replace(/^\\\\s+|\\\\s+$/g, ''); } } These three simple functions let you test for the presence of a class, add a class, and remove a class. In conjunction, they make basic DOM manipulation really easy.\\nUpdate on August 27, 2013: I\\u0026rsquo;ve combined these class handlers, along with a few other useful functions, into a vanilla JS micro-library called Buoy that I now use on all of my projects.\\nUpdate on April 20, 2014: Buoy no longer uses these class handlers, and has been converted to a classList polyfill forked from classList.js by Eli Grey.\\nUpdate on June 9, 2014: Since I\\u0026rsquo;m using Eli Grey\\u0026rsquo;s classList.js polyfill, Buoy is no longer needed and has been removed from GitHub. If you\\u0026rsquo;d prefer to use class handlers, though, check out Apollo from Todd Motto.\\nPutting it all together Let\\u0026rsquo;s say I have a set of links with the .sandwich class. Whenever one of them is clicked, I want to see if it has the .mustard class well. If it does, I\\u0026rsquo;d like to remove it, and if it doesn\\u0026rsquo;t, I want to add it.\\nHere\\u0026rsquo;s what that would look like:\\n// Class Handlers var hasClass = function (elem, className) { return new RegExp(' ' + className + ' ').test(' ' + elem.className + ' '); } var addClass = function (elem, className) { if (!hasClass(elem, className)) { elem.className += ' ' + className; } } var removeClass = function (elem, className) { var newClass = ' ' + elem.className.replace( /[\\\\t\\\\r\\\\n]/g, ' ') + ' '; if (hasClass(elem, className)) { while (newClass.indexOf(' ' + className + ' ') = 0 ) { newClass = newClass.replace(' ' + className + ' ', ' '); } elem.className = newClass.replace(/^\\\\s+|\\\\s+$/g, ''); } } // Sandwich Functions if ( 'querySelector' in document \\u0026\\u0026 'addEventListener' in window ) { var sandwiches = document.querySelectorAll('.sandwich'); for (var i = 0, len = sandwiches.length; i  Less jQuery.

Fortunately, there\\u0026rsquo;s an easy fix: throttling.\\nThrottling Your JavaScript JS resize throttling is a two-part approach:\\n You create a function that does whatever you need to have happen on resize. Within the .resize() method, you run the function and set a timeout on it so it won't run again for a predefined amount of time.  Here\\u0026rsquo;s what it looks like:\\n(function($) { var resizeTimer; // Set resizeTimer to empty so it resets on page load function resizeFunction() { // Stuff that should happen on resize }; // On resize, run the function and reset the timeout // 250 is the delay in milliseconds. Change as you see fit. $(window).resize(function() { clearTimeout(resizeTimer); resizeTimer = setTimeout(resizeFunction, 250); }); })(jQuery); You can adjust the delay based on how much of a lag you\\u0026rsquo;re comfortable with. Even 100 milliseconds makes a big difference in performance. Check out this demo Ben Alman put together.\\nRunning on Page Load If you have stuff that you want to run on resize and page load, you can also call the function outside of .resize():\\n(function($) { var resizeTimer; // Set resizeTimer to empty so it resets on page load function resizeFunction() { // Stuff that should happen on resize }; // On resize, run the function and reset the timeout // 250 is the delay in milliseconds. Change as you see fit. $(window).resize(function() { clearTimeout(resizeTimer); resizeTimer = setTimeout(resizeFunction, 250); }); resizeFunction(); })(jQuery); Now, resizeFunction() will run when the page loads, and again whenever the browser window is resized.\\n\",\"summary\":\"On a recent project, I used the jQuery .resize() method to detect when a user resized their browser and run certain code.\\nThere are performance concerns with doing so, though.

They all regularly linked to each other and parroted each others\\u0026rsquo; ideas.\\nHumans as a species are drawn to ideas that reinforce our own beliefs.\\nLast year, I made a deliberate choice to diversify my reading habits. I started following blogs on a wider variety of topics. I started following new people on Twitter. Since then, I have found myself pruning back to a slightly less diverse group of content, because to be honest, there\\u0026rsquo;s a lot of content out there, and I don\\u0026rsquo;t want to waste time reading things that bore me.\\nBut the echo-chamber effect isn\\u0026rsquo;t a web 2.0 or social media problem. It happens in real life, too. Humans often surround themselves with like minded people.\\nThe Suburbification of the Web One exception to this is densely populated cities, where you\\u0026rsquo;re forced to interact with a diverse range of people. And this is where I think social media does cause some (but not all) of the problems.\\nFive or ten years ago, it was harder to find stuff on the web. You had to interact with a diverse set of content and ideas. The internet was all city.\\nToday, social media makes it easy for you to find like-minded people and interact with them. Twitter and Facebook are suburban developers. But Google also got better at search. It serves results based on your prior habits, which makes results more useful.\\n(Seriously, try searching for something with personal results hidden. It takes more digging to find content that\\u0026rsquo;s most relevant to you.)\\nIt\\u0026rsquo;s been the suburbification of the internet, not just social media, that has stripped away some of the diversity. Social media is one factor, not the root cause.

It looks like some databases on shared hosting may have been compromised.\\nRepairing the damage took me about two hours. Here\\u0026rsquo;s how I fixed it\\u0026hellip; How the Hack Worked\\nBased on what I read on the WordPress support forums, hackers gained access to WordPress databases on GoDaddy shared hosting. From there, they were able to create admin users and gain access to the site itself.\\nThey added a PHP script to the site\\u0026rsquo;s functions.php file that would add hidden links in the header to a spam site as a way of generating SEO. The links are typically only visible to search engine bots, so site owners often won\\u0026rsquo;t even realize they\\u0026rsquo;re there.\\nI discovered them after a reader noticed them briefly while visiting the site. Then, the Twitter iPhone app browser displayed them (just once) when I was looking at my site.\\nIf you want to check if you\\u0026rsquo;ve been infected, open up your functions.php file and look for a long, suspicious string of code that starts with function callbackx. It will probably be at the top of the file.\\nBackups I use the WordPress Database Backup plugin to run weekly backups of my database.\\nSince this seemed to be a database compromise that could have gone back many months, I decided to instead wipe out my site completely and install a fresh version of WordPress, database and all. I was worried that hackers could have added malicious files or alternate access points into the database itself.\\nExporting Your Files Using the built-in Export tool, I exported all of my posts as an XML file.\\nThen, I accessed my server by FTP and my Uploads folder (under WP Content) to my desktop. This is where all of the images I upload to posts are saved. I scanned each folder for any files that were not image files. Fortunately, none existed.\\nPlugins I also took note of all of the few plugins I use, so I wouldn\\u0026rsquo;t miss any on the reinstall. These could have been compromised or editted, too, so they\\u0026rsquo;ll need to be reinstalled from scratch.\\nYour Theme I use GitHub to version control my site, so I already had a local copy of the latest version of my theme.\\nI hope you do, too, because the hackers edited theme files. You\\u0026rsquo;ll want to install a fresh, clean copy of your theme. Don\\u0026rsquo;t just download the version that\\u0026rsquo;s currently on your server. It has malicious code in it.\\nDelete WordPress Before you do this, make sure you\\u0026rsquo;ve saved copies of your posts and Uploads folder to your computer.\\nLog in to GoDaddy. Under All Products \\u0026gt; My Account, select Web Hosting and click \\u0026ldquo;Launch\\u0026rdquo;. On the page, there\\u0026rsquo;s an \\u0026ldquo;Options \\u0026amp; Settings\\u0026rdquo; heading, and below that \\u0026ldquo;Popular Apps\\u0026rdquo;. Click the \\u0026ldquo;Show all\\u0026rdquo; link. Under \\u0026ldquo;My Management\\u0026rdquo; in the right-hand sidebar, select \\u0026ldquo;Manage My Applications\\u0026rdquo; (they really make this difficult!).\\nFind your WordPress site from the list, and click either \\u0026ldquo;View and manage details\\u0026rdquo; or \\u0026ldquo;Update Now,\\u0026rdquo; depending on how recently you\\u0026rsquo;ve updated your core files. Click \\u0026ldquo;Uninstall Application\\u0026rdquo; and follow the on-screen instructions. GoDaddy will uninstall your WordPress installation, including your database.\\nFor good measure, you should also log in to your server by FTP and delete the entire directory for your site.\\nReinstall WordPress Once the uninstall is complete, you can reinstall WordPress. Go back to the \\u0026ldquo;Popular Applications\\u0026rdquo; page and select WordPress. Click \\u0026ldquo;Install Now,\\u0026rdquo; and follow the on-screen instructions to get setup.\\nI would recommend using new names and passwords for both your database and admin account. I would also change your FTP password at this time.\\nGoDaddy will send you an email when WordPress has been reinstalled. It usually only takes a few minutes.\\nGetting Setup Once WordPress has been reinstalled, login to your admin panel.\\nThere\\u0026rsquo;s a few things you\\u0026rsquo;ll need to do:\\n Under \\\"Settings,\\\" you'll want to update things like Timezone settings, permalink structure, and so on to match your previous setup. You should also click on your Profile under users and make sure your information is setup the way you want. Open up your site in your FTP client and copy your Uploads folder back under the WP Content folder. This will ensure that any photos in your blog posts still work. Under \\\"Tools,\\\" select \\\"Import\\\" and install the WordPress import plugin. Once it's installed, select your exported posts XML file and run the importer. Attribute all posts to your new admin user name. Upload a fresh copy of your theme and activate it.  This whole process took me about an hour or two.

Today, I can\\u0026rsquo;t think of a good reason to maintain a separate mobile site. The Trouble with Context\\nMany arguments in favor of a separate mobile site seem to center around user context.\\nThere\\u0026rsquo;s a belief that mobile users exist in a specific and limited context: busy, distracted, and focused on only one type of information. That particular context is just one of many that can and do apply to mobile users.\\nIn the Trouble With Context, the folks at Yiibu point out that mobile users aren\\u0026rsquo;t always just looking for information. They\\u0026rsquo;re also reading while commuting, entertaining themselves while they wait in line, or browsing the web while watching TV.\\nIn the latest report from Google and Nielsen, it\\u0026rsquo;s noted that\\u0026hellip;\\n77% of mobile searches are in a location (work or home) likely to have a PC available to them. We can\\u0026rsquo;t infer intent or environment based on the size of one\\u0026rsquo;s screen.\\nTime Travel and the Web In Windows on the Web, Karen McGrane writes\\u0026hellip;\\nWhile you’re at work, you read a restaurant review for a new place you think sounds tasty. Come dinnertime, you grab your phone to pull up the address and location. One night on your tablet, you’re browsing articles for a report you’re writing at work. Back at your desk the next day, you struggle in vain to remember what you searched for to find those articles. Why can’t you find them again? Sound familiar? If you’re like most people, it probably does. Research from Google shows that 90 percent of people start a task using one device, then pick it up later on another device. People now expect access to the same content on any device. Not being able to find content, or being able to find it but not access it, is incredibly frustrating for users.\\nBrad Frost keeps a running list of sites that fail at this over at WTF Mobile Web. It\\u0026rsquo;s a good study in what to avoid.\\nReducing Content The gentleman I was chatting with on LinkedIn mentioned that for mobile users, he intended to share about 50 percent less content and reduce the steps in their checkout process to make it more efficient.\\nI think that\\u0026rsquo;s a great idea, but I don\\u0026rsquo;t think it should be limited to the mobile site.\\nIf 50 percent less information is the right amount of information people need to complete their tasks, then you should only provide that 50 percent on all devices. And if visitors on laptops could use that additional information, why wouldn\\u0026rsquo;t someone on a smaller screen want access to it, too?\\nSimilarly, if you can process a checkout in just two or three steps instead of five, why wouldn\\u0026rsquo;t desktop users benefit from that as well?\\nWhen less is less On his about page, Frank Chimero notes\\u0026hellip;\\nSome things are truly diminished when simplified. I think there\\u0026rsquo;s truth to that. It\\u0026rsquo;s important not to simplify just for the sake of simplifying when thinking about smaller screen devices.

Email Signoffs\\nIn this piece on email signoffs, Matthew J.X. Malady argues that we should discontinue using any form of goodbye at the end of our emails\\u0026hellip;\\nThink about it. Email signoffs are holdovers from a bygone era when letter writing—the kind that required ink and paper—was a major means of communication. The handwritten letters people sent included information of great import and sometimes functioned as the only communication with family members and other loved ones for months. In that case, it made sense to go to town, to get flowery with it. Then, a formal signoff was entirely called for... But those times have long since passed. No. Just no.\\nIf you\\u0026rsquo;re in the middle of a back-and-forth volley of emails, sure, drop the signoff. (Or better yet, pick up the phone. Email sucks for that kind of correspondence.)\\nBut for an initial communication, a farewell is just good manners, and those seem to be few and far between nowadays. Not saying \\u0026ldquo;goodbye\\u0026rdquo; in an email is like just hanging up the phone once you\\u0026rsquo;ve said what you have to say. Who does that?\\nDoes it take an extra few seconds to say goodbye? Sure. But spending a few extra seconds to be polite is time well spent.\\nGoodbye to \\\"Hello\\\"? Matthew takes it a step further, arguing\\u0026hellip;\\nAnd while we’re at it, why stop at the signoff alone? Unless the person you are writing to doesn’t know you, or the two of you have never met, you can do away with your name at the bottom as well. And you can generally leave off your recipient’s name at the beginning, too... The recipient saw your name in the sender field when she clicked on the email, and she knows her name, too, it’s generally safe to assume. There’s no need for repetition. Remember, we’re streamlining here. All our lives are about to get simpler. They also see your name on caller ID, but you wouldn\\u0026rsquo;t just start rambling as soon as the phone stops ringing, would you?\\nI get that email is a real problem for some people. But being rude to shave a few seconds off your typing isn\\u0026rsquo;t the solution.\\nIf you\\u0026rsquo;re overwhelmed by email, you\\u0026rsquo;re doing it wrong. Solve the underlying problem, which is that you get too many damn emails. Maybe you\\u0026rsquo;re over-relying on it for your communication. Seriously, phone calls solve a lot of issues that emails create.\\n\\\"No one listens to voicemail anymore.\\\" In his articles on how the digital era is redefining communication etiquette, Nick Bilton writes\\u0026hellip;\\nMy father learned this lesson last year after leaving me a dozen voice mail messages, none of which I listened to. Exasperated, he called my sister to complain that I never returned his calls. “Why are you leaving him voice mails?” my sister asked. “No one listens to voice mail anymore. Just text him.” If my father calls, I listen to his voicemails. It\\u0026rsquo;s faster to talk than to type on a mobile phone. It\\u0026rsquo;s more nuanced, too. It\\u0026rsquo;s not always faster, but faster isn\\u0026rsquo;t always better.\\nNick continues\\u0026hellip;\\nMy mother realized this long ago. Now we communicate mostly through Twitter. Communicating with your mom through Twitter. How\\u0026hellip; personal. This is the woman who gave birth to you. Answer her damn phone calls.\\nCommunication Overload I get that information overload is a serious problem for people.\\nEmail. Phone. Text. Twitter. Facebook. Instagram. BlackBerry Messenger (ha, just kidding!). There are a lot of ways to connect with people, and it can be overwhelming.\\nReducing the number of communication vehicles may not be the right solution. These forms of communication are all great\\u0026hellip; in the right context. Sometimes a phone call is a better choice than email. Sometimes texting is better.

But because Internet Explorer 8 and lower do not recognize media queries, they get the small screen layout instead of the bigger screen version on mobile-first designs.\\nFortunately, there\\u0026rsquo;s a pretty simple fix that allows you to code mobile first and provide a bigger screen experience for older IE browsers. What is mobile first?\\nMobile first, from a coding perspective, means that your base style is typically a single-column, fully-fluid layout. You use @media (min-width: whatever) to add a grid-based layout on top of that.\\nThe alternative - desktop first - involves starting with a wide, grid-based layout, and using @media (max-width: whatever) to scale down to a single-column layout.\\nWhy mobile first? iPhone and Android browsers are quite capable, but older smart phones, feature phones and other small-screen devices like gaming consoles may not support media queries.\\nImagine trying to read tiny text in a big screen layout on an old, underpowered feature phone.\\nMobile first web design extends progressive enhancement to site layout, allowing you to serve simple, readable content to all devices, and layer on structure and presentation for more capable devices.\\nMobile first and Internet Explorer Unfortunately, Internet Explorer 8 and older don\\u0026rsquo;t recognize media queries. That means, they get the base, small screen version of a mobile first website instead of the bigger screen version.\\nThat may work well for simple, content-based sites, but it may not always be acceptable for certain designs.\\nFortunately, there\\u0026rsquo;s a pretty simple fix that allows you to code mobile first and provide a bigger screen experience for older IE browsers.\\nA Conditional IE Class We\\u0026rsquo;re going to add a conditional .ie class to our html element just for older Internet Explorer browsers. This will let us add some conditional styling later that only applies to those browsers.\\nReplace the html element with this code:\\n\\u0026lt;!-- Conditional class for older versions of IE --\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;!--[if lt IE 9 \\u0026 !IEMobile]\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;html class=\\\"ie\\\" lang=\\\"en\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;![endif]--\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;!--[if gt IE 8 | IEMobile]\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;!--\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;html lang=\\\"en\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;!--\\u0026lt;![endif]--\\u0026gt; Why the html and not the body? A lot of JavaScript functions target the body element. This helps avoid any conflicts.\\nYou\\u0026rsquo;ll also notice that we\\u0026rsquo;re not adding the .ie class to IE Mobile browsers. Those are typically on small screen devices, so we want them to receive the small screen layout.\\nAdding Conditional CSS Rather than serving a conditional IE stylesheet, we\\u0026rsquo;ll be adding a few IE specific modifications to our main stylesheet. It makes it easier (for me, anyways) to keep track of things when I make changes and updates.\\nLet\\u0026rsquo;s say I\\u0026rsquo;m using a simple three-column grid (adapted from the Kraken boilerplate) like this:\\n@media (min-width: 40em) { .row { margin-left: -1.515151515152%; margin-right: -1.515151515152%; } [class^=\\\"grid-\\\"], [class*=\\\" grid-\\\"] { float: left; width:96.969696969697%; margin-left: 1.515151515152%; margin-right: 1.515151515152%; } .grid-third { width: 30.30303030303%; } .grid-half { width: 46.969696969697%; } .grid-two-thirds { width: 63.636363636364%; } } To make that work in Internet Explorer 8 and lower but still serve a mobile first layout, I would copy-and-paste the content outside of the media query, and prefix each class with .ie.\\nHere\\u0026rsquo;s what the example above would look like:\\n@media (min-width: 40em) { .row { margin-left: -1.515151515152%; margin-right: -1.515151515152%; } [class^=\\\"grid-\\\"], [class*=\\\" grid-\\\"] { float: left; width:96.969696969697%; margin-left: 1.515151515152%; margin-right: 1.515151515152%; } .grid-third { width: 30.30303030303%; } .grid-half { width: 46.969696969697%; } .grid-two-thirds { width: 63.636363636364%; } } .ie .row { margin-left: -1.515151515152%; margin-right: -1.515151515152%; } .ie [class^=\\\"grid-\\\"], .ie [class*=\\\" grid-\\\"] { float: left; width:96.969696969697%; margin-left: 1.515151515152%; margin-right: 1.515151515152%; } .ie .grid-third { width: 30.30303030303%; } .ie .grid-half { width: 46.969696969697%; } .ie .grid-two-thirds { width: 63.636363636364%; } Now all devices will be served the mobile first layout, and older Internet Explorer browsers will get the bigger screen styling.\\nFollow this format for any bigger screen content that you want to work on IE8 and lower.\\nWhat about Respond.js? A few folks, both in the comments and on Twitter, have pointed out that Respond.js, a cool little script from Scott Jehl, takes care of all this without you having to write a single extra line of code. Why don\\u0026rsquo;t I just that?\\nIn a word: control. As Scott notes in the documentation:\\nAs you might guess, this implementation is quite dumb in regards to CSS parsing rules. This is a good thing, because that allows it to run really fast, but its looseness may also cause unexpected behavior. There are enough things that go wrong when dealing with older browsers. Adding another dependency that have little control over just doesn\\u0026rsquo;t sit well with me. But a lot of people like and use Respond.js, so I thought it was at least worth mentioning.\\nThis section was added on December 14, 2013.\\nThings to consider Does it add bloat to your code? A little. Is it a pain? Yep.\\nIt\\u0026rsquo;s worth considering whether or not providing the small screen layout is \\u0026ldquo;good enough\\u0026rdquo; for older Internet Explorer browsers before going down this path.\\n\",\"summary\":\"Mobile first web design extends progressive enhancement to site layout.

There\\u0026rsquo;s not a single pixel in the stylesheet.\\nRelative sizing can be a bit tricky to get the hang of, but once you do, it\\u0026rsquo;s actually really easy to work with and has a lot of great benefits.\\nLet\\u0026rsquo;s look at how it all works. The Base Font-Size Web browsers set a default font-size of 16px.\\nIf you set the font-size to 100% in your stylesheet (or didn\\u0026rsquo;t set it at all), your text would render at 16px. If the visitor had changed their default font-size to 20px, your text would render at 20px.\\nWhen you set sizes in pixels, nothing changes if your visitor adjusts their default font-size.\\nMany web designers like the control this gives them, but relative sizing is better for usability. It gives control to the visitor and allows people who have accessibility needs (for example, someone who\\u0026rsquo;s visually impaired and needs to read at larger font-sizes) the ability to modify the content to fit their needs.\\nYou don\\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about this breaking your layout. If all of your sizing uses relative values, when the default font-size changes in a visitor\\u0026rsquo;s browser, all of the site elements will scale with it.\\nThis is good for you as a designer, too. Imagine being able to adjust everything on your site by changing a single value!\\nAdjusting the Base Font-Size On larger screens (about 1280px), the base font-size on the body element in Kraken is 125%. What is that in pixels?\\n1.25 (125%) * 16px = 20px  If that\\u0026rsquo;s a bit too big or small for your design, you can adjust it by changing the percentage on the body element in the stylesheet. Changing it 100% gives you a font-size of 16px. Changing it to 112.5% results in 18px text.\\nAvoid going below 100%. That\\u0026rsquo;s the default browser font-size for a reason.\\nChanging Other Elements The body is the only element sized as a percentage. All other elements are sized using ems.\\n1em is equal the font-size of the object you\\u0026rsquo;re manipulating. So if you\\u0026rsquo;re working with default text set at 16px, 1em = 16px. If you\\u0026rsquo;re working with a heading that has a font-size of 24px, 1em = 24px.\\nFor example, an h1 heading has a font-size of 1.5em. In pixels, that\\u0026rsquo;s:\\n16px (our base font-size) * 1.5em = 24px  If you knew you wanted that element to be 24px wide, you can calculate the ems by dividing the desired value by the base:\\n24px / 16px = 1.5em  The margin-bottom of 1em on that h1 heading is based on the heading size, not the body size. Here\\u0026rsquo;s what that looks like:\\n24px * 1em = 24px  This is what makes relative sizing so awesome. If you change the body size, all other page elements will proportionately scale up or down with it\\u0026mdash;and each other\\u0026mdash;because their sizing is relative to the base font-size.\\nAn Example Let\\u0026rsquo;s say you wanted to change the margin-left on sorted and unsorted lists.\\nBy default, those are set as margin-left: 2em in the Kraken stylesheet. What is that value in pixels currently, and how would you change it?\\n16px * 2em = 31px  If you wanted to set that margin to a bigger size, say 48px, here\\u0026rsquo;s what you\\u0026rsquo;d do:\\n48px / 16px = 3em  Pretty easy!\\nWorking with a Typographic Scale You may be wondering where I got the pixel values that I used in these examples.\\nKraken was built on a typographic scale using the Typograph app. All of the values in the stylesheet are taken from that scale:\\n1px, 4px, 5px, 8px, 9px, 11px, 12px, 13px, 15px, 16px, 19px, 21px, 24px, 28px, 32px, 48px, 64px, 80px, 96px  If you\\u0026rsquo;re going to change any of the values in the Kraken stylesheet, your design will feel more harmonious if you use one of these pixel values as your reference.\\nEven if you change the base font-size on the body element, use 16x as your working base. Remember, everything scales relative to the base your base font-size may not be 16px anymore, but the em value you get from dividing by 4px won\\u0026rsquo;t really be 4px anymore, either.\\nIt\\u0026rsquo;s the relative value between elements that makes the scale work.\\n\",\"summary\":\"The Kraken boilerplate uses only relative sizing.

Wait\\u0026hellip; huh?\\nI know what you\\u0026rsquo;re thinking: isn\\u0026rsquo;t that easy to do already? You can use this bit of code to make HTML5 videos responsive:\\nvideo { max-width: 100%; height: auto; } When you try that with iframes, though, the sizing gets all messed up. Check out this short video from Dave Rupert showing the problem in action\\u0026hellip;\\n For a while, I was using the FitVids.js, the awesome jQuery plugin Dave mentions in the video. FitVids.js is really, really awesome.\\nAnd the Todd Motto released FluidVids.js, which is even awesomer (yes, awesomer is a word).\\nWhy FluidVids Rocks FluidVids is written in vanilla JavaScript. It works with any JavaScript framework you want to use (or none at all). The minified version is less 1kb in size. You don\\u0026rsquo;t need to target or activate anything. Just add the script to your site and you\\u0026rsquo;re good to go.\\nWhat I like most about FluidVids, though, is that it\\u0026rsquo;s really easy to customize. Want to add SlideShare or Hulu or whatever? Super easy to do!\\nGetting Started Getting started with FluidVids is really easy:\\n Download it. Add the script to your site. That's it!  Adding a Fallback You don\\u0026rsquo;t need to do this, but I liked to add a fallback in case JavaScript isn\\u0026rsquo;t enabled or working.\\nIf someone accesses your site from a small-screen device without JavaScript support, videos will extend beyond the page wrapper and mess up your layout. Here\\u0026rsquo;s the code I use:\\niframe { max-width: 100%; } Yes, that does look a lot like the code for fluid HTML5 video. The only difference is that I\\u0026rsquo;ve left out height: auto;.\\nIf JavaScript isn\\u0026rsquo;t working, the iframe will be a normal width on bigger screens, and fluid on smaller ones, but the height won\\u0026rsquo;t change. Video containers will look a bit disproportionately tall, but the videos themselves will be normal proportioned and work just fine.\\nAdding Other Services Note: FluidVids has been rewritten, and no longer requires you to hack the core code to add additional vendors.\\nTo add other services to FluidVids, open up the JavaScript file and find this line:\\nvar players = /www.youtube.com|player.vimeo.com/; That\\u0026rsquo;s where you\\u0026rsquo;ll add URLs for other iframe services. The URL structure will vary by service, and the easiest way to find it is to get the embed URL for a service you\\u0026rsquo;d like to add and look at the iframe src.\\nAn Example As an example, here\\u0026rsquo;s the embed code for a SlideShare presentation:\\n\\u0026lt;iframe src=\\\"http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/8049732?rel=0\\\" width=\\\"427\\\" height=\\\"356\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" marginwidth=\\\"0\\\" marginheight=\\\"0\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" style=\\\"border:1px solid #CCC;border-width:1px 1px 0;margin-bottom:5px\\\" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/iframe\\u0026gt; The part we care about is src=\\u0026ldquo;\\u0026hellip;\\u0026rdquo;. The \\u0026ldquo;base\\u0026rdquo; for the SlideShare embed code is www.slideshare.net. That\\u0026rsquo;s what we\\u0026rsquo;ll add to fluidvids.js.\\nIn fluidvids.js, we\\u0026rsquo;ll add www.slideshare.net to var players, separated by a |.

Today, I wanted to talk about my experience implementing it. Working with a Grid\\nAdopting a dog is both a logical decision (size, energy level, etc.) and an emotional one (this dog is cute/manly/awesome). I wanted to tap into both sides of the decision-making process by displaying big, beautiful photos of dogs alongside key information.\\nOne of the things I love about working with responsive grids like Kraken (which powers the PAWS website) is how flexible they are. Building a responsive showcase for PAWS dogs was as simple as tying into the existing grid.\\nPotential adopters can search for their new best friend on any device with an internet connection.\\nCached for Faster Loading APIs can be slow, and Petfinder\\u0026rsquo;s is no exception.\\nThe biggest factor impacting Petfinder API performance was the number of animals you were requesting information for. PAWS saves hundreds of animals each year, and we obviously want people to see all of the dogs they have available.\\nThe API was taking upwards of 60 seconds to load, and because their site is powered by WordPress and generated on-demand, nothing would display until the API was finished rendering. Not good.\\nThe solution to this was really simple.\\nThe PAWS website already uses the Quick Cache plugin to increase site performance. The plugin pre-builds the dog list page once an hour and serves that, eliminating the need to ping to the API every time someone wants to see a list of dogs.\\nClient-Side Filtering There are a lot of different things you might look for when adopting a dog.\\nPuppy or older dog? Small, large, or somewhere in between? Male or female? How are they with other dogs? With cats? Only interested in certain breeds?\\nI wrote a simple jQuery script that allows for real-time, client-side filtering.\\nRather than rebuilding the page each time someone changes criteria, everyone gets the same HTML (which allows us to take advantage of the cache plugin I mentioned earlier). Each dog is assigned classes for various things: gender, age, breed and so on. When you toggle one of the filters, the jQuery script looks for dogs who match that class and hides or shows them based on your criteria.\\nVery lightweight. Very fast.\\nProgressively Enhanced Given the diversity of devices that can access the internet today, it\\u0026rsquo;s really important that sites are fully functional on devices that lack support for media queries, JavaScript and so on.\\nThe list of PAWS dogs starts as a simple grid with photos of dogs and basic info. Clicking on a dog takes you to their Petfinder listing.\\nIf your browser supports JavaScript, the filters are added, allowing you sort through dogs that match your criteria. Clicking on a dog opens up a drop-down menu with more information and a full-description, as well as a link to an adoption form if you really like the dog.\\nBut even without JavaScript, the page still works.\\nA little help I have to give major kudos to Bridget Wessel and her Petfinder Listings plugin. While my solution forgoes the plugin, her PHP was instrumental in getting the API data into WordPress.\\nDefinitely give her work a look.\\nThe Petfinder API for WordPress Toolkit To help other developers who may be looking to do something similar, I open sourced my code. Check out the Petfinder API for WordPress Toolkit on GitHub.\\nNote: I\\u0026rsquo;ve released a CMS-agnostic JavaScript plugin for working with Petfinder called petfinderAPI4everybody.js.\\nAnd if you\\u0026rsquo;re looking to adopt an awesome dog (or just want to see a whole bunch of cuteness), check out PAWS New England.\\n\",\"summary\":\"The PAWS New England dog rescue website is responsive, but the Petfinder widget they were using to display the dogs they have available for adoption was not.\\nLast month, I built them a custom solution using the Petfinder API.

If your site isn\\u0026rsquo;t fast, people will just leave.\\nToday, I want to share a few simple things you can do to dramatically improve the performance of your site. Using these techniques, I\\u0026rsquo;ve gotten Go Make Things to load in less than a second, running WordPress on inexpensive shared hosting. The Steps\\nWe\\u0026rsquo;ll be doing a few things:\\n Concatenate. Combining like files together. Minify. Removing the spacing, line breaks and comments from files. Smush. Removing unneeded data from image files. Icon Fonts. Icon fonts are a lighter, faster alternative to image-based icons. Compress. Reduce file size by up to 70 percent. Cache. Telling browsers to keep static assets stored locally so that they doesn’t have to be re-downloaded every time they visit your site. Page Structure. Adjusting the location of CSS and JavaScript files for faster rendering.  Let\\u0026rsquo;s get started\\u0026hellip;\\nConcatenate One of the biggest bottlenecks in page load time is in downloading the actual files for your site.\\nEach HTTP request adds additional load time. It\\u0026rsquo;s actually faster for a browser to download one 100kb file than it is to download two 50kb files. By combining similar file types together, you can improve page performance.\\nWhen you can, combine all of your javascript into a single .js file. Rather than loading separate .css files for your base styles, small screens, bigger screens and so on, combine them all into a single stylesheet with media queries.\\nAnd don\\u0026rsquo;t think you can cheat by using the @import rule. That still requires additional HTTP requests.\\nMinify Minifying is the process of removing spacing, line breaks and comments from your CSS, HTML, and javascript. Though it might not seem like a big deal, removing all those unused elements can decrease the size of your files by 40 percent or more.\\nFor this, you\\u0026rsquo;ll need Google Chrome and the Page Speed Add-On.\\nMinify Your CSS In Google Chrome, run the Developer Tools and click on the “Page Speed” tab. Then click “Analyze.”\\nYou’ll be given an overall score, and a list of things you can do to improve your score.\\nOne of the items on the list will be “Minify CSS.” Click it. Under “Suggestions for this page” is a link to “see optimized content.” Follow that to get a minified version of your CSS provided by Google.\\nRather than overwrite my human-readable CSS, I paste the minified code into a new file called style-min.css. Reference that in the header of your HTML.\\nMinify Your JavaScript In the Developer Tools Window, click on “Minify Javascript” and repeat the process above to access a minified version of your script from Google. If you’re using jQuery, Google also provides a minified version of that you can use.\\nPaste the minified code into a new file called js-min.js, and change the link in your HTML to that file.\\nMinify Your HTML There are a few ways to minify your HTML.\\nIf you\\u0026rsquo;re building static webpages, the Developer Tools Window in Google Chrome will contain a “Minify HTML” recommendation. You can follow the same process as with the CSS and JavaScript.\\nIf you\\u0026rsquo;re using WordPress, there\\u0026rsquo;s actually code you can add to your functions.php file to dynamically serve minified HTML.\\nBetween \\u0026lt;?php and ?\\u0026gt; add this bit of code (.txt file), courtesy of DVS. If you view source after making this update, you’ll see a message at the bottom of the page telling you how much the file was compressed.\\nOne issue I have discovered: If you use inline AJAX, this code may prevent it from working properly. If you find this to be the case, set protected $compress_js = true; to \\u0026ldquo;false\\u0026rdquo; instead, and it will leave javascript uncompressed.\\nSmush Images in their raw form often have a lot of extra but unneeded data in them. This makes the file sizes up to 60 percent bigger than they need to be.\\n“Smushing” images is the process of removing that unneeded data and optimizing them for web viewing.\\nSmushing Apps So how exactly do you smush an image? There’s an app for that!\\nI downloaded ImageOptim, which is unfortunately Mac only. It’s a simple drag-and-drop application, and actually shows you how much smaller the file is after smushing.\\nIf you’re on a PC, you can also use Smush.it, a web-based app from Yahoo.\\nBetter file types It’s worth noting that I’m not just smushing my images, but also making smarter decisions about file types.\\nHistorically, I would save all of my images as PNGs files. PNG is a lossless image format, so it keeps graphics sharp and crisp (as opposed to the lossy JPG format). However, PNGs are also substantially larger than JPGs.\\nFor icons, PNGs make a lot of sense (or used to – more on that in a minute). But for something like a photo of people or places, which already have a lot of noise in them, a JPG is actually a better format because it’s much smaller in size.\\nIcon Fonts Rather than using PNGs for my icons, I actually use an embedded web font.\\nUsing the IcoMoon app, I was able to create a custom font set with just the icons I need. It weighs in at just 4kb and results in just a single HTTP request, which drastically improves performance.\\nAnd because I’m loading a font and not images, they can be scaled smoothly to any size, styled easily using CSS, and don’t get distorted on retina displays. If you don’t go the icon font route, you should use image sprites instead.\\nCompress In Apache HTTP servers, .htaccess (hypertext access) is the configuration file that allows for web server configuration.\\nWith a simple modification to your .htaccess file, you can tell the server to send your files compressed as gzip files. This reduces file size by about 70 percent.\\nLearn how with this tutorial on GitHub.\\nCache Setting cache headers tells browsers to keep static assets stored locally so that a visitor’s browser doesn’t have to re-download them every time they visit your site.\\nThis is also something that\\u0026rsquo;s done using the .htaccess file. Follow these instructions on GitHub.\\nCaching for WordPress If your site is powered by WordPress, there\\u0026rsquo;s an additional step you can take that will dramatically improve performance.\\nEach time someone accesses your site, WordPress dynamically generates an HTML page for them using server-side processing. Caching your WordPress files will create static HTML pages ahead of time that get stored on the server and sent to visitors. This is a lot faster than WordPress creating a fresh page each time someone visits your site.\\nThere are a few plugins that do this for you, most notably WP Super Cache and W3 Total Cache. Both require a bit of tweaking and tailoring, though, and can be a bit confusing to set up.\\nI prefer Comet Cache. There\\u0026rsquo;s only one thing you really need to do: switch it to on.\\nComet Cache automatically updates pages every hour (in case content has changed), and for people who are logged in or who have left comments, it serves them the dynamically generated pages instead of cached ones.\\nThis reduced my page load times by about 30 percent.\\nPage Structure There are two last changes you should make: Make sure you load your stylesheet at the top of the page and your JavaScript at the bottom (when possible).\\nThis doesn\\u0026rsquo;t make the page download content any faster, but it does help browsers start displaying it more quickly.\\nIn order to avoid having to redraw elements, browsers will wait until the stylesheet is loaded before displaying content. If the CSS file is one of the last things to download, people who visit your site will stare a blank page for longer.\\nBrowsers typically download multiple files at once. However, some browsers block other files from downloading while a javascript file is being loaded. Putting your scripts at the bottom of the page ensures that more of your content is downloaded and displayed as quickly as possible.\\nYour High Performance Website These techniques took me about 30 minutes to get set up. This site now loads in under a second, running WordPress on inexpensive shared hosting.\\nYour performance may vary a bit (I also have an extremely small CSS file and don\\u0026rsquo;t use jQuery on this site), but these tips should still make a big difference.\\nReferenced \\u0026 Useful Resources  Web Performant Wordpress by Dave Rupert.

Here\\u0026rsquo;s why I built Kraken\\u0026hellip; Frameworks\\nCSS frameworks are great. I used Bootstrap for a while, and learned a lot about CSS3 and Object Oriented CSS. I even adapted some Bootstrap code for a few Kraken add-ons.\\nBut like many frameworks, Bootstrap includes a lot of stuff - way more than I\\u0026rsquo;d typically need for any given project. When I\\u0026rsquo;d get ready to launch, I\\u0026rsquo;d find myself removing as much of the code as I could and hoping I didn\\u0026rsquo;t accidentally break something by removing an important class without realizing it.\\nBecause frameworks are so robust, they have the potential to result in bloated code. It\\u0026rsquo;s like using a sledgehammer to hang a photo.\\nBoilerplates Boilerplates are in many ways the opposite of frameworks.\\nThey don\\u0026rsquo;t try to provide a complete package. Instead, they provide a starting point that you can build on. HTML5 Boilerplate is one of the most popular, and for good reason - it\\u0026rsquo;s packed with lots of tricks and best practices for better development. I adapted a few pieces of HTML5 Boilerplate into Kraken as well.\\nIf frameworks are too robust, boilerplates are often too light. They don\\u0026rsquo;t include everything you\\u0026rsquo;ll need - just a few building blocks. When trying to use them, I often found myself digging through old projects or frameworks to find code I could reuse.\\nI designed Kraken to combine what I love best about frameworks and boilerplates into a single product.\\nBuilt to Scale By itself, Kraken is boilerplate.\\nIf your project is small, it might have everything you need, but chances are it\\u0026rsquo;s just a starting point. And it\\u0026rsquo;s pretty light on styling so that you can easily adapt it to whatever your design is.\\nBut what makes Kraken shine are the add-ons - tools that you can use to extend the functionality of Kraken. Rather than taking a framework and removing what you don\\u0026rsquo;t use, you start with a simple foundation and add on what you need.\\nBuilding a WordPress site? Try the Kraken for WordPress add-on. Need a navigation menu? Check out Astro. Drop-down menus? Toggle tabs? We\\u0026rsquo;ve got you covered.\\nAll of the add-ons have been designed to get dropped right in to Kraken. The stylesheet even has placeholders so you know exactly where in the cascade to put them.\\nIs Kraken right for you? So is Kraken right for you? Depending on your level of skill, it might not be.\\nIf you\\u0026rsquo;re just getting started with this stuff, a more robust framework might be a better fit. You\\u0026rsquo;ll see how different components integrate and work together.\\nBut if you\\u0026rsquo;d like to start with something more lightweight and scale it out (or not) to fit your projects, Kraken might be a great tool for you.\\n\",\"summary\":\"When I released the Kraken boilerplate last week, someone asked me, \\u0026ldquo;How does it differ from [Bootstrap/Foundation/Your Favorite Framework Here]?\\u0026rdquo; Fair question.\\nI\\u0026rsquo;ve used frameworks, and I\\u0026rsquo;ve used boilerplates, and love them both.

This is a nice usability technique so that people always know where on a site they are.\\nThis is actually really easy to do in WordPress using a simple trick I picked up from Chris Coyier a few years ago. Here\\u0026rsquo;s the technique: We\\u0026rsquo;ll assign each page and each navigation link a unique ID, and when they match, we\\u0026rsquo;ll add styling.\\nUpdate: There\\u0026rsquo;s actually a simpler and more elegant way to do this than what I describe here. Check out this great tutorial from Todd Motto.\\nLet\\u0026rsquo;s look at how it works\\u0026hellip; Create an ID for the page\\nThe first thing we\\u0026rsquo;ll do is add a snippet of PHP to the header.php file that will create a unique ID for each page.\\n\\u0026lt;?php $page = $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']; $page = str_replace(\\\"/\\\",\\\"\\\",$page); $page = str_replace(\\\".php\\\",\\\"\\\",$page); $page = $page ? $page : 'default' ?\\u0026gt; This creates a variable and assigns it a value equal to the page slug. So if the page your on is www.my-site.com/about, then the value of $page will be \\u0026ldquo;about.\\u0026rdquo; It assigns the home page a value of \\u0026ldquo;default.\\u0026rdquo;\\nAdd an ID to your page Next, we need to add an ID to each page. We\\u0026rsquo;ll use this snippet to do that\\u0026hellip;\\nid=\\\"\\u0026lt;?php echo $page ?\\u0026gt;\\\" I add this to my \\u0026lt;header\\u0026gt; element, but you can also add it to the \\u0026lt;body\\u0026gt; element instead. The ID will match the page URL.\\nAdd an ID to your navigation links Next, we need to add an ID to each navigation link.\\nFor ease, I use the prefix \\u0026ldquo;nav-\\u0026rdquo; and match the rest of the ID to the URL. For example, the About page navigation link has an ID of id=\\u0026ldquo;nav-about\\u0026rdquo;.\\nHere\\u0026rsquo;s what a simple navigation menu using this technique might look like\\u0026hellip;\\n\\u0026lt;ul\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;li\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;a id=\\\"nav-home\\\" href=\\\"/\\\"\\u0026gt;Home\\u0026lt;/a\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/li\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;li\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;a id=\\\"nav-about\\\" href=\\\"/about/\\\"\\u0026gt;About\\u0026lt;/a\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/li\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;li\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;a id=\\\"nav-search\\\" href=\\\"/search/\\\"\\u0026gt;Search\\u0026lt;/a\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/li\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;/ul\\u0026gt; Add styling to your CSS The last step is to adding styling to the CSS file. In this example, we\\u0026rsquo;ll simply underline the navigation element that matches the current page, though you can do a lot more here. Since I have a dedicated search page, I also want search results to highlight the search navigation link as well.\\n#default #nav-home, #about #nav-about, #search #nav-search, [id^=\\\"?s\\\"] #nav-search { text-decoration: underline; } This tells browsers that if the ID \\u0026ldquo;nav-home\\u0026rdquo; is a sub-element of a section with the ID \\u0026ldquo;default,\\u0026rdquo; or \\u0026ldquo;nav-about\\u0026rdquo; is a sub-element of a section with the ID \\u0026ldquo;about,\\u0026rdquo; and so on, that it should apply an underline to the element.\\nSearches in WordPress generate a URL that starts with \\u0026ldquo;?s.\\u0026rdquo; [id^=\\u0026ldquo;?s\\u0026rdquo;] #nav-search says that if \\u0026ldquo;#nav-search\\u0026rdquo; is a sub-element of a section with an ID that starts with \\u0026ldquo;?s\\u0026rdquo; (it can contain any text after it), then apply the styling.\\nYou could take a similar approach for category pages, individual blog posts, and more. If you\\u0026rsquo;re not sure what the ID or ID prefix is, publish your site with the page ID code, and then view source.\\nCombined Code Here\\u0026rsquo;s a very simplified version of the code altogether on a single page\\u0026hellip;\\n\\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;html lang=\\\"en\\\"\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;head\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;meta charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\"\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;title\\u0026gt;Page Title\\u0026lt;/title\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;style\\u0026gt; #default #nav-home, #about #nav-about, #search #nav-search, [id^=\\\"?s\\\"] #nav-search { text-decoration: underline; } \\u0026lt;/style\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;/head\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;?php if (is_single()) { $prefix = 'page'; } $page = $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']; $page = str_replace(\\\"/\\\",\\\"\\\",$page); $page = str_replace(\\\".php\\\",\\\"\\\",$page); $page = $page ? $page : 'default' ?\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;body id=\\\"\\u0026lt;?php echo $page ?\\u0026gt;\\\"\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;h1\\u0026gt;Blog Title\\u0026lt;/h1\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;ul\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;li\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;a id=\\\"nav-home\\\" href=\\\"/\\\"\\u0026gt;Home\\u0026lt;/a\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/li\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;li\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;a id=\\\"nav-about\\\" href=\\\"/about/\\\"\\u0026gt;About\\u0026lt;/a\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/li\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;li\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;a id=\\\"nav-search\\\" href=\\\"/search/\\\"\\u0026gt;Search\\u0026lt;/a\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/li\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;/ul\\u0026gt; Page Content \\u0026lt;/body\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;/html\\u0026gt; Obviously in WordPress the header, footer and body content would be in their respective templates, and the CSS would be in it\\u0026rsquo;s own file.

First, you\\u0026rsquo;re creating a function named my_scripts_method. In that function, you\\u0026rsquo;re deregistering the built-in version of jQuery, and then registering the version Google hosts in its place.\\nFinally, you\\u0026rsquo;re telling WordPress to activate that version. The add_action script tells WordPress to run the function you\\u0026rsquo;ve created.\\nAdding your personal javascript file If you\\u0026rsquo;re loading jQuery on your site, chances are you\\u0026rsquo;re running your own javascript plugins. If those are going to be used throughout the site, it\\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to put them in an external file that can be cached by browsers for faster loading.\\nYou can use the my_scripts_method function above to do that, too. We\\u0026rsquo;ll be adding the following pieces of code to the function above:\\nwp_register_script('my-js', get_template_directory_uri() . '/YOUR-JS-PATH.js', false, null, true); wp_enqueue_script('my-js'); I host my javascript files in a subfolder of my theme files. get_template_directory_uri() references my theme URL. If you include your javascript file elsewhere, change the URL accordingly. The remainder of the path is the subfolder and file name. On my site, that section is written as get_template_directory_uri() . \\u0026lsquo;/js/gmt.js\\u0026rsquo;.\\nYou\\u0026rsquo;ll notice that at the end of the registration snippet, it says \\u0026ldquo;true.\\u0026rdquo; This variable determines whether or not the file will be included in the footer. I have mine set to true, because footer loading is better for performance. If your file needs to be loaded in the header, change it to \\u0026ldquo;false\\u0026rdquo; or remove it altogether (false is the default).\\nHere\\u0026rsquo;s what the final version of the function should look like.\\n// Create the my_scripts_method function function my_scripts_method() { // Deregister the built-in version of jQuery wp_deregister_script('jquery'); // Register a CDN hosted version.

Different Types of Color Blindness\\nA lot of folks think that being color blind means you see the world in grayscale. That\\u0026rsquo;s typically not the case.\\nIndividuals with three of common forms of color blindness - deuteranopia, protanopia, and tritanopia - still see colors, but they see them as different hues than people without color blindness. Red and green are the colors most often affected (PDF). And, color blindness seems to affect men far more often than women.\\nThe problem with red links Red is a pretty common color in web design. Unfortunately, it also causes some problems for color blind individuals. Here\\u0026rsquo;s a sentence with a red link\\u0026hellip;\\nHere\\u0026rsquo;s what that same link looks like for someone with tritanopia\\u0026hellip;\\nAs you can see, the hue is a bit off, but it\\u0026rsquo;s still quite readable. Tritanopia, however, is a very rare form of color blindness.\\nDeuteranopia is far more common, affecting 5% of all males. Here\\u0026rsquo;s what that link looks like for individuals with this form of color blindness\\u0026hellip;\\nThe contrast between the link and text isn\\u0026rsquo;t great. A visitor could probably still make out the link, but it\\u0026rsquo;s far from ideal. I\\u0026rsquo;ve used a pretty dark text color in this example (#272727). For lower-contrast sites, the effect would be even more pronounced.\\nProtanopia affects 2.5% of all males. Here\\u0026rsquo;s what the link looks like for individuals with this form of colorblindness\\u0026hellip;\\nHere, you can see that the link is barely distinguishable from the text. That\\u0026rsquo;s a real problem.\\nHow to make links more accessible There are a few things you can do to make links more accessible for individuals with color blindness.\\nI test all of my designs with Color Oracle, a free, cross-platform color blindness simulator that allows you to see what your site (or any other thing you make on a computer) looks like to indviduals with the three forms of color blindness mentioned above.\\nThe blue links on this site are easily distinguishable from plain text to all three forms of color blindness.\\nIf you want to use a color that has contrast issues (like red or green), use more than one indicator to let people know it\\u0026rsquo;s a link. You might, for example, underline links in addition to making them a different color.\\nWith a few simple modifications, you can make your website far more accessible for color blind individuals.\\n\",\"summary\":\"Are the links on your website visible to people with color blindness?

Originally, it was an entirely different letter called thorn, which derived from the Old English runic alphabet, Futhark. Thorn, which was pronounced exactly like the “th” in its name, is actually still around today in Icelandic. We replaced it with “th” over time—thorn fell out of use because Gothic-style scripting made the letters y and thorn look practically identical. And, since French printing presses didn’t have thorn anyway, it just became common to replace it with a y. Hence naming things like, “Ye Olde Magazine of Interesting Facts” (just as an example, of course). \\u0026ldquo;Thorn\\u0026rdquo; is just one of a handful of letters that were at one time part of the alphabet.

Darrow had dreamed up what he described as a real estate trading game whose property names were taken from Atlantic City, the resort town where he’d summered as a child. Patented in 1935 by Darrow and the corporate game maker Parker Brothers, Monopoly sold just over 2 million copies in its first two years of production, making Darrow a rich man and likely saving Parker Brothers from bankruptcy... The game’s true origins, however, go unmentioned in the official literature. Three decades before Darrow’s patent, in 1903, a Maryland actress named Lizzie Magie created a proto-Monopoly as a tool for teaching the philosophy of Henry George, a nineteenth-century writer who had popularized the notion that no single person could claim to “own” land. In his book Progress and Poverty (1879), George called private land ownership an “erroneous and destructive principle” and argued that land should be held in common, with members of society acting collectively as “the general landlord.” Read the whole story at Harper\\u0026rsquo;s Magazine.\\n\",\"summary\":\"Monopoly has long been one of my favorite board games.

Here are a few of my favorite quotes\\u0026hellip;\\nOn Great Products You could almost place every product that we [make] on this table. I mean, if you really look at it, we have four iPods. We have two main iPhones. We have two iPads, and we have a few Macs. That’s it. And we argue and debate like crazy about what we’re going to do, because we know that we can only do a few things great. That means not doing a bunch of things that would be really good and really fun. That’s a part of our base principle, that we will only do a few things. And we’ll only do things where we can make a significant contribution. - Tim Cook On Doing Great Work There’s more pressure that comes from within than from the outside. Our customers have an incredibly high bar for us. We have an even higher bar for ourselves. So we want to do great work, and yeah, people are always talking about what we may do next and when it might happen, but honestly we’re driven much more internally by great people who want to do great work. - Tim Cook On Changing Your Mind More so than any person I ever met in my life, [Steve Jobs] had the ability to change his mind, much more so than anyone I’ve ever met. He could be so sold on a certain direction and in a nanosecond (Cook snaps his fingers) have a completely different view. I thought in the early days, “Wow, this is strange.” Then I realized how much of a gift it was. So many people, particularly, I think, CEOs and top executives, they get so planted in their old ideas, and they refuse or don’t have the courage to admit that they’re now wrong. Maybe the most underappreciated thing about Steve was that he had the courage to change his mind. - Tim Cook \",\"summary\":\"Businessweek conducted an excellent interview with Apple CEO Tim Cook.

This week, I dropped the plugin in favor of a few lines of code in my header. First, a word about SEO\\nMany years ago, I was told it\\u0026rsquo;s really important to include meta keywords in the header so that search engines know what\\u0026rsquo;s on the page. After years of slimy SEO specialists gaming the system by loading sites up with irrelevant keywords in the header, sites like Google no longer pay attention to them. What about the description meta tag? That doesn\\u0026rsquo;t really matter much either, although search engines often use that to display a few lines about the site in their results.\\nThere is a new tag you can now include: link rel=\\u0026ldquo;canonical\\u0026rdquo;. This tells Google which URL for a site is the main one. This is particularly important on ecommerce sites that often have multiple URLs for one page, like www.buystuff.com/robot and www.buystuff.com/robots?sizes. Setting the canonical will tell Google which of those two is the main URL. Not as important for blogs, but still worth including.\\nSo the only two things that I really care about customizing are the title and the canonical. I\\u0026rsquo;m ok with Google using the first few lines of a post as the description in their search results, except on the landing page, where I want something a bit more explanatory.\\nChanging the Title In the header.php file, I replaced the default title content with this snippet of code courtesy of Todd Motto\\u0026rsquo;s HTML5 Blank\\u0026hellip;\\n\\u0026lt;?php wp_title(''); ?\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;?php if(wp_title('', false)) { echo ' |'; } ?\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;?php bloginfo('name'); ?\\u0026gt; Updated on March 5, 2013 with Todd\\u0026rsquo;s snippet, which is way simpler than what I had been using before and achieves the same result.\\nAdding a Description Underneath the title tag, I added this bit of code\\u0026hellip;\\n\\u0026lt;?php if (is_home ()) : // if homepage ?\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;meta name=\\\"description\\\" content=\\\"\\u0026lt;?php bloginfo( 'description' ); // Pulls site description ?\\u0026gt;\\\"\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;?php endif; ?\\u0026gt;  The if (is_home()) statement tells WordPress to only show this content on the landing page.\\nAdding a Canonical This one\\u0026rsquo;s crazy simple. Underneath the description if statement, I added\\u0026hellip;\\n\\u0026lt;link rel=\\\"canonical\\\" href=\\\"\\u0026lt;?php the_permalink() ?\\u0026gt;\\\"\\u0026gt; That simply uses the main permalink for the page as the canonical link.\\nThis took less than five minutes and just a few lines of code, and allowed me to stop using a pretty big plugin.\\n\",\"summary\":\"I hate using plugins for things that I can easily do myself with a few lines of PHP.\\nI\\u0026rsquo;d been using the All-In-One SEO Pack plugin for years, but lately, I\\u0026rsquo;ve only been using it to override the default page and post titles.

To help you use it, I\\u0026rsquo;m writing a series of tutorials on how to make some common changes.\\nToday, we\\u0026rsquo;ll be adding a sidebar to Go Mobile First. Getting Setup\\nBefore we get started, there\\u0026rsquo;s a few things you\\u0026rsquo;ll need to do:  Download a good text editor. Gedit is free, cross-platform, and works really well. Install MAMP (or WAMP if you use Windows). This will let us work locally so we don\\u0026rsquo;t mess up a live site. You can find really good instructions on setting up MAMP on Smashing Magazine. If you didn\\u0026rsquo;t install WordPress as part of your MAMP setup, do that now. \\nCreating a Backup Before we start working, save a copy of Go Mobile First and rename the folder \\u0026ldquo;go-mobile-first-with-sidebar.\\u0026rdquo; Then open up the style.css file and change the theme name to Go Mobile First with Sidebar. If we mess anything up, you want it to be a copy, not the only version of your site.\\nLaunch the WordPress admin panel and activate our \\u0026ldquo;new\\u0026rdquo; theme. Then, pull up the site.\\nNow, let\\u0026rsquo;s get to it!\\nNote: This tutorial is based on version 1.4 of Go Mobile First, which was the most recent version at time of writing.\\nStarting with Mobile First First, let\\u0026rsquo;s sketch out how we want the site to look on small screens, and then how we\\u0026rsquo;ll enhance it for bigger screens.\\nOn small screens, we\\u0026rsquo;ll keep our single column layout. The sidebar will appear below the body content but above the footer.\\nOn bigger screens, the content will float to the left, and the sidebar will float to the right.\\nAdding a Sidebar to the HTML Create a new file in your text editor and save it to the Go Mobile First with Sidebar folder under the name sidebar.php. This is the name WordPress uses to for the sidebar template.\\nFor now, write \\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;This is the sidebar\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt; and save the file. We\\u0026rsquo;ll come back and add real content later.\\nWe need to refer to the sidebar template in all of the locations where we want it to appear. Those include:  The archive of posts by category, tag, etc. (archive.php) The landing page (index.php) Individual pages (page.php) Individual posts (single.php) \\nOpen up each of those files in your text-editor and locate \\u0026lt;?php get_footer(); // Pulls in the footer.php template ?\\u0026gt;. Just above that bit of code, add:\\n\\u0026lt;?php get_sidebar(); // Pulls in the sidebar.php template ?\\u0026gt; As the comment says, this pulls in the sidebar template. Save each of the files, and refresh your browser. Down at the bottom of your site, you should see this:\\nIt\\u0026rsquo;s not much to look at just yet, but that\\u0026rsquo;s ok. We just need to add some styling.\\nDefining the Structure On small screen, we want the sidebar to appear down at the footer, but on bigger screens, we want it to float to the right.\\nWe\\u0026rsquo;ll need to make some updates to our stylesheet. Open up style.css.\\nWe don\\u0026rsquo;t need to change our mobile-first base styles, so scroll down to the Media Queries section and locate:\\n/* For screens greater than 680 pixels in width */ @media (min-width: 681px) { On bigger screens, we\\u0026rsquo;re going to reset the .container width to 960 pixels. Since our articles and pages aren\\u0026rsquo;t the only content on the page anymore, we\\u0026rsquo;ll need to add a new structure calls to set the width for the main content section, as well as a new class to set the width for the sidebar.\\nAt the top of this section, add the following code:\\n/* A fixed width on bigger screens. Set the container width to 960 pixels. We need to reset max-width to match. */ .container { width: 960px; max-width: 960px; } /* Set width of main content area and float to the left */ .main { width: 640px; float: left; } /* Set width of sidebar and float to the right */ .aside { width: 260px; float: right; } Save and refresh your browser.\\nYou should notice that your site content is now really wide. That\\u0026rsquo;s because we haven\\u0026rsquo;t added these new classes to the HTML yet.\\nAdding Structure to the HTML Let\\u0026rsquo;s start with the sidebar.\\nOpen up sidebar.php. We\\u0026rsquo;re going to wrap the content in \\u0026lt;aside class=\\u0026ldquo;aside\\u0026rdquo;\\u0026gt; and \\u0026lt;/aside\\u0026gt;. Aside is one of the new semantic divs in HTML5. While you can style these elements directly, we use this div for several other things in Go Mobile First, so we\\u0026rsquo;ll use the aside class to style it.\\nYour sidebar.php file should look like this:\\n\\u0026lt;aside class=\\\"aside\\\"\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;This is the sidebar\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;/aside\\u0026gt; Next, open up index.php. Below \\u0026lt;?php get_header(); // Pulls in the header.php template ?\\u0026gt;, add \\u0026lt;div class=\\u0026ldquo;main\\u0026rdquo;\\u0026gt;. At the bottom of the page above \\u0026lt;?php get_sidebar(); // Pulls in the sidebar.php template ?\\u0026gt;, add \\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt;.\\nYour code should look like this:\\n\\u0026lt;?php get_header(); // Pulls in the header.php template ?\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;!-- This is the template for the page that displays all of your blog posts --\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;div class=\\\"main\\\"\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;!-- A BUNCH OF PAGE CONTENT --\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;?php get_sidebar(); // Pulls in the sidebar.php template ?\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;?php get_footer(); // Pulls in the footer.php template ?\\u0026gt; Save and refresh your browser. Your site should now look like this:\\nNow repeat the process you used with index.php on archive.php, single.php, and page.php.\\nClearing Floats You may notice there\\u0026rsquo;s a random line next to the sidebar. That\\u0026rsquo;s an issue cause by the float: left and float: right properties on the .main and .aside sections. The border on the footer is wrapping around the main content section.\\nThe .container section clears floats, but it\\u0026rsquo;s called after the footer. Let\\u0026rsquo;s fix that.\\nIn footer.php, there\\u0026rsquo;s this snippet of code:\\n\\u0026lt;/section\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;!-- End the main section (started in the header) --\\u0026gt; This ends the \\u0026lt;section class=\\u0026ldquo;container\\u0026rdquo;\\u0026gt; div that\\u0026rsquo;s started in the header. Cut-and-paste to the top of the footer.php template. This will end that section and clear floats before the footer starts.\\nHowever, this also means there\\u0026rsquo;s no container around the footer content anymore so let\\u0026rsquo;s add one. You code should now look like this:\\n\\u0026lt;/section\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;!-- End the main section (started in the header) --\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;!-- Start the footer section. Class tags center and lighten text, and reduce font size. --\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;footer class=\\\"container small muted text-center\\\"\\u0026gt; Save and refresh your browser. This is what you should see:\\nViola! No more line.\\nAdjusting the Break Point If you decrease the size of your browser, you\\u0026rsquo;ll notice that a lot of content moves offscreen before the site shifts to the fluid base layout. That\\u0026rsquo;s because the min-width parameter on the media query is based on a 640 pixel wide site, not a 960 pixel one.\\nAccounting for 20 pixels of padding on each side, the new breakpoint should be 1001 pixels - 960 pixels plus 40 pixels plus 1 pixel more than the largest size for base styles.\\nUpdate the media query so that it looks like this:\\n/* For screens greater than 1,000 pixels in width */ @media (min-width: 1001px) { Save and refresh your browser. If you decrease the size of your browser window, the site should now resize itself correctly.\\nFinishing Touches On smaller screens, the sidebar content blends in to the main content section. Let\\u0026rsquo;s add a top-border that only appears on small screens.\\nFirst, open up style.css. Under @media (min-width: 1001px), let\\u0026rsquo;s add a new class we can use to hide items on big screens:\\n.hide-big-screens { display: none; } Add that snippet after the .alignright styling, and then open up sidebar.php. Just after \\u0026lt;aside class=\\u0026ldquo;aside\\u0026rdquo;\\u0026gt;, add:\\n\\u0026lt;hr class=\\\"hide-big-screens\\\"\\u0026gt; This inserts a line that\\u0026rsquo;s hidden on screens that are bigger than 1,000 pixels. Save and refresh your browser.\\nYou may notice that on bigger screens the sidebar text appears to be a bit higher than the main content. That\\u0026rsquo;s because h1 tags have a top-padding of 14 pixels. To line things up nicely, add the .padding-top class, which adds 14 pixels of top padding, to the aside div:\\n\\u0026lt;aside class=\\\"aside padding-top\\\"\\u0026gt; Save and refresh your browser. The sidebar content should now be lined up with the content in the main section.\\nSwitching Sides Rather have your sidebar on the left? That\\u0026rsquo;s easy.\\nWe still want it to appear below the main section on smaller screens, so we don\\u0026rsquo;t even need to touch the HTML. We\\u0026rsquo;ll just switch the floats on bigger screens.\\nOpen up style.css and locate this bit of code:\\n/* Set width of main content area and float to the left */ .main { width: 640px; float: left; } /* Set width of sidebar and float to the right */ .aside { width: 260px; float: right; } We\\u0026rsquo;re simply going to switch .main to float: right and .aside to float: left, like this:\\n/* Set width of main content area and float to the right */ .main { width: 640px; float: right; } /* Set width of sidebar and float to the left */ .aside { width: 260px; float: left; } Save and refresh your browser. And that\\u0026rsquo;s that.\\nWrapping Up You\\u0026rsquo;ve now added a sidebar to the Go Mobile First theme. Nice work!\\nTo move these updates to your live site, upload the modified theme to your web server (if you use WordPress\\u0026rsquo;s built-in theme uploader, you\\u0026rsquo;ll need to zip the file first) and activate it.\\nIf you got stuck anywhere along the way, you can download the files from this tutorial on GitHub.\\n\",\"summary\":\"About a month ago, I released a free mobile-first starter theme for WordPress called Go Mobile First.

We want to wrap this section in a background color.\\nRight before the \\u0026lt;header\\u0026gt; element, add this:\\n\\u0026lt;!-- Adds background color to navigation area --\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;div class=\\\"nav-wrap\\\"\\u0026gt; Right after the \\u0026lt;/header\\u0026gt; element, add:\\n\\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;!-- End Nav Wrap --\\u0026gt; This creates a wrapper around the header that we will style with the background color. Click save and refresh your browser.\\nNothing should happen. That\\u0026rsquo;s because we haven\\u0026rsquo;t added any styling to nav-wrapper yet.\\nStyling the Nav-Wrapper Open style.css and scroll down to navigation section.\\nBefore .logo:hover, add this:\\n/* Adds background color to navigation area */ .nav-wrap { background-color: #272727; } That sets the nav-wrapper background color to black.\\nSave and refresh your browser. The site should now look like this.\\nAs you can see, there are a few issues:  It doesn\\u0026rsquo;t fill the whole width. Go Mobile First applies a 20 pixel padding to the left and right of the body. That\\u0026rsquo;s what\\u0026rsquo;s causing this. The logo and navigation aren\\u0026rsquo;t visible. The borders on the navigation, which add needed division on an all white design, look weird with the background. \\nLet\\u0026rsquo;s fix these.\\nGoing Full Width In style.css, under .nav-wrap, add: margin-left: -20px; margin-right: -20px;\\nThe negative margin pulls the nav-wrap all the way to the edge and balances out the 20 pixel body padding. We also want to add 20 pixels of left and right padding inside the .nav-wrap, since the negative margins negate the body padding.\\nThe final version of the code should look like this:\\n/* Adds background color to navigation area. Negative margin pull background color to the edge. Padding balances out the negative margin. */ .nav-wrap { background-color: #272727; margin-left: -20px; margin-right: -20px; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; } Save and refresh your browser. The site should now look like this:\\nNow we\\u0026rsquo;re getting somewhere! Next, let\\u0026rsquo;s tackle the invisible navigation.\\nChanging the Navigation Color In the out-of-the-box version of Go Mobile First, navigation element colors are controlled by the muted class. Open header.php and remove muted from all nav elements.\\n\\u0026lt;ul class=\\u0026ldquo;nav muted responsive-nav\\u0026rdquo;\\u0026gt; becomes \\u0026lt;ul class=\\u0026ldquo;nav responsive-nav\\u0026rdquo;\\u0026gt;. \\u0026lt;ul class=\\u0026ldquo;nav muted\\u0026rdquo;\\u0026gt; becomes \\u0026lt;ul class=\\u0026ldquo;nav\\u0026rdquo;\\u0026gt;.\\nSave and refresh your browser.\\nAs you can see, the nav elements are now the default link blue, and black on hover. We\\u0026rsquo;re getting there, but it\\u0026rsquo;s still not quite right.\\nMaking Navigation Links White We want the navigation links to be white, both when inactive and on hover. In style.css, after:\\n/* Styling for nav elements that are links */ .nav  li  a { float: none; /* Add padding between elements */ padding: 10px 10px 11px; } Add:\\n/* Overrides default link color for nav elements */ .nav  li  a, .nav  li  a:hover { color: #ffffff; } Save and refresh your browser.\\nYou can see they\\u0026rsquo;re now white, with the default underline on hover. Now let\\u0026rsquo;s remove the navigation border.\\nRemoving the Navigation Border Back in style.css, find .nav and delete:\\n/* Add gray lines above and below list */ border-top: 1px solid #e5e5e5; border-bottom: 1px solid #e5e5e5; In the default Go Mobile First themes, we remove the border from the collapsed navigation on smaller screens. Since that border no longer exists, we don\\u0026rsquo;t need to remove it for smaller screens.\\nScroll down to the media queries section, and under @media (max-width: 680px) delete:\\n/* Remove the border elements from the nav menu */ .js .nav-mobile  .nav { border: none; } Save and refresh your browser.\\nLooking much better. Of course, the logo is still invisible. Let\\u0026rsquo;s fix that next.\\nChanging the Logo Color In style.css, find .logo:hover. This controls the behavior for the logo link. Right now it\\u0026rsquo;s just adjusting the logo on hover state, so we need to add .logo, before it. Your code should look like this:\\n/* Overrides default link behavior for logo text. */ .logo, .logo:hover { color: #272727; text-decoration: none; } We don\\u0026rsquo;t actually want the color to be black. We want it to be white. Replace #272727 with #ffffff. Your code should now look like this:\\n/* Overrides default link behavior for logo text. */ .logo, .logo:hover { color: #ffffff; text-decoration: none; } Save and refresh your browser.\\nMuch better! One thing I noticed, though. The gap between the site description and the navigation seems a bit big. Let\\u0026rsquo;s decrease it.\\nClosing the Gap In header.php, find this bit of code:\\n\\u0026lt;!-- Description of site with lightened text and bottom margin. --\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;p class=\\\"muted\\\"\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;?php bloginfo( 'description' ); // Insert site description ?\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt; We want to add the no-space-bottom class to the paragraph element. As its name implies, this class sets the bottom margin and bottom padding of an HTML element to zero.\\nYour new code should look like this:\\n\\u0026lt;!-- Description of site with lightened text and bottom margin. --\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;p class=\\\"muted no-space-bottom\\\"\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;?php bloginfo( 'description' ); // Insert site description ?\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt; Save and refresh your browser. The site should now look like this.\\nOne last thing. The spacing below the navigation looks a bit tight now that there\\u0026rsquo;s a background color. Let\\u0026rsquo;s add a little breathing room.\\nAdding a Little Padding In style.css, go to .nav-wrap, and add padding-bottom: 14px;.\\nWhy 14 pixels? That\\u0026rsquo;s one of the numbers in our typographic scale, and it\\u0026rsquo;s used for spacing throughout this theme\\u0026rsquo;s design.\\nYour final code should look like this:\\n/* Adds background color to navigation area. Negative margin pull background color to the edge. Padding balances out the negative margin. */ .nav-wrap { background-color: #272727; margin-left: -20px; margin-right: -20px; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 14px; } Save and refresh your browser.

To help you use it, I\\u0026rsquo;m writing a series of tutorials on how to make some common changes.\\nThis article looks at the styles in the Go Mobile First stylesheet and how they\\u0026rsquo;re used. OOCSS\\nGo Mobile First loosely applies the principles of Object Oriented CSS (OOCSS):  Separate the structure from the content. Don\\u0026rsquo;t repeat yourself (DRY). \\nWhenever possible, I use unnested, general purposes classes. This had led to fewer cross-browser issues and CSS that is more lightweight and easily maintainable.\\nFor example, rather than writing:\\n#footer { font-size: 15px; } I have a class for smaller fonts:\\n.small { font-size: 15px; } This get\\u0026rsquo;s applied to both footer content and other pieces of text that I\\u0026rsquo;d like to make smaller than the body copy. Simpler, more reusable code.\\nI\\u0026rsquo;m more pragmatic than I am strict - for example, it\\u0026rsquo;s more practical for me to apply a top-padding to my header elements than to use class=\\u0026ldquo;padding-top\\u0026rdquo; on every header in my HTML - but overall, OOCSS has made my life easier.\\nNow, let\\u0026rsquo;s look at the styles used in Go Mobile First.\\nThe Reset Right now the web design community is split between using a CSS reset and Normalize.css, which both work towards the same goal from different angles.\\nI\\u0026rsquo;ve found that Meyer\\u0026rsquo;s CSS Reset results in more consistent browser rendering for me, so that\\u0026rsquo;s what I use. But Normalize.css does have a few useful bits that result in better looking images, and fix issues with HTML5 audio and video rendering. I\\u0026rsquo;ve incorporated some of that stuff, as well as a few of my own additions for responsive images and video, into my reset.\\nStructure Content in Go Mobile First is wrapped in divs with the .container class.\\n/* Literally \\\"contains\\\" the content on the page */ .container { /* Sets the maximum width of the content */ max-width: 640px; /* Centers the container */ margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; /* Adds a padding to the top of the container */ padding-top: 26px; } Divs with this class have a maximum width of 640 pixels, but are otherwise fluid. margin-left: auto; and margin-right: auto; tell browsers to automatically set the left and right margins, which centers the div on the page.\\nFor white space, I\\u0026rsquo;ve applied 26 pixels of padding to the top of each container.\\nTypography The Go Mobile First design is built around a typographic scale: 14px, 15px, 17px (base), 20px, 23px, 26px, 30px, 34px, 51px, 68px, 85px, 102px.\\nYou\\u0026rsquo;ll see these numbers repeated throughout the CSS. Deviating from them will break the scale and result in a less pleasant design (unless, of course, you change the entire scale).\\nLine height is set at 25 pixels for smaller screens, and 27 pixels for larger ones. These numbers were determined using Chris Pearson\\u0026rsquo;s Golden Ratio Typography Calculator.\\nTypographic Elements In addition to the usual stuff - typefaces, links, paragraph spacing, headers, lists - I\\u0026rsquo;ve added some unique classes.\\n.small is used for content that you want to be smaller than the body text. .tall and .grande make content slightly bigger than the body copy, but unlike headers, their line spacing is more suited to longer lines of text.\\nFor text that you\\u0026rsquo;d like to be lighter in color than the primary body copy, use .muted. When .muted sections of content contain links, they appear black instead of the default blue.\\nIf you have content that is part of a list, but you don\\u0026rsquo;t want it to be styled as one, use .unstyled. While this can be applied to both ordered and unordered lists, it only makes sense semantically to do so to unordered lists.\\nFinally, each header element also has a matching class. If you wanted to use an h2 element for semantic purposes, but wanted it to look like an h4 element, you could write \\u0026lt;h2 class=\\u0026ldquo;h4\\u0026rdquo;\\u0026gt;.\\nForms The form styling borrows from Twitter Bootstrap, which does an excellent job of creating beautiful forms.\\nBecause Go Mobile First is so lightweight, I\\u0026rsquo;ve removed most of the styling and kept the basic elements - things like text color, rounded corners, and active states. I also modified them to match the typographic scale of the theme.\\nThe classes .input-small, .input-medium, and .input-wide are used to set the widths of the input fields, and change slightly from small to large screens. All text areas are given a height of 200 pixels.\\nButtons Buttons in Go Mobile First are created using CSS. Simply apply the .btn class to any link, input or form button. Also include .btn-large to make any button bigger (.btn must still be used).\\nIcons Icons are not included with Go Mobile First, but there is a section open in the stylesheet where you might want to add them. I recommend using an icon font, and have put together a tutorial on how to do that.\\nImages Go Mobile First includes some basic image styles, again borrowed from Twitter Bootstrap.\\n.img-rounded adds rounded borders, .img-polaroid adds white borders and a shadow effect, and .img-circle turns square images into circles.\\nThese can be used in combination. For example, you could have a polaroid-style image with rounded corners. .img-rounded and .img-circle are not supported by Internet Explorer 8 and lower.\\nCollapse \\u0026 Fade These styles are used to show and hide the navigation elements on smaller screens that support javascript.\\nTables Table styling is also borrowed from Twitter Bootstrap, but modified with the Go Mobile First typographic grid.\\nThe reset at the beginning of the stylesheet removes all of the default styling browsers apply to tables. Add the .table class to any table for light styling: some padding, horizontal lines between rows, and bold table headers.\\nFor less padding between cells, also use .table-condensed. For full borders, also include .table-bordered. (For both of these, .table must also be used.) These classes can be combined.\\nA Basic Table A Condensed Table A Bordered Table I\\u0026rsquo;ve removed .table-striped and .table-hover from the Bootstrap code, as they disrupt the clean and simple layout of Go Mobile First.\\nNavigation The .logo class is (obviously) applied to the logo link, and overrides the default link behavior, keeping the logo link black at all times.\\nThe .nav class is applied to the navigation list. For the base styles, it displays the navigation links as an inline list. On smaller screens that support javascript, they\\u0026rsquo;re stacked as block elements.\\nThe .responsive-nav class is used for the \\u0026ldquo;menu\\u0026rdquo; link that toggles the navigation menu on javascript-enabled smaller screens. It\\u0026rsquo;s set to display: none; in the base styles, and changed to display: block; in the Media Queries section.\\nFloats \\u0026 Hides This is stuff is tucked at the bottom so that it overrides any other settings in the base CSS.\\nThe default image alignment classes that WordPress uses - .alignleft, .alignright, .aligncenter, and .alignnone - are all set as centered in the base styles. On larger screens, they float to the left and right as appropriate.\\n.text-center, .text-left, and .text-right align text in the center, to the left, and the right, respectively. .pull-right floats objects to the right.\\nTo remove margins and padding from an object, use the .no-space class. .no-space-bottom and .no-space-top will remove margins and padding just from the bottom or top of an object. .small-space-bottom leaves just a small amount of margin at the bottom of an object.\\n.padding-top applies 14 pixels of padding to the top of an object, while .margin-bottom applies a 34 pixel margin to the bottom.\\nSometimes you want an element to appear in your HTML for people using screen readers, but don\\u0026rsquo;t want it to be displayed visually. In those cases, use the .screen-reader class. This is currently applied to the skip-nav link, as well as the search form label.\\nThe end of this section contains a few classes with a clearfix applied. This removes any floats contained in those sections, which prevents weird formatting issues. To apply a clearfix to an div not already covered here, use the .group class.\\nMedia Queries This is where progressive enhancement occurs.\\nFor smaller screens, formatting is added for javascript-enabled devices. On larger screens, the line-height is increased for more comfortable reading, a few elements gain bigger font-sizes or more padding, and images are aligned to the left or right as appropriate.\\nThe .nav-mobile.collapse class is really important. If someone has their browser set to a small size and toggles the navigation menu, and then later expands their browser window, the navigation bar could be hidden. This nested class forces it to always be displayed on larger screens.\\nReferenced \\u0026 Useful Resources  Object Oriented CSS Meyer's CSS Reset Normalize.css Typography First Web design Twitter Bootstrap Using an Icon Font \",\"summary\":\"A few weeks ago, I released a free mobile-first starter theme for WordPress called Go Mobile First.

Internet access is virtually ubiquitous, and for a large and rapidly growing percentage of people, the internet is something you rarely or never access on a computer.\\nObviously, people are browsing the web on tablets and smart phones. But they\\u0026rsquo;re also browsing on gaming consoles like X-Box and Gameboy, on web-enabled TVs, and on older or not-so-smart phones. I\\u0026rsquo;ve even heard of folks using the Kindle e-ink browser to do things like send emails and read on the web.\\nScreen sizes, device capabilities, and user contexts all vary wildly. Your job is to make sure everyone who wants to can access your content.\\nResponsive Web Design Over the last couple of years, Responsive Web Design (RWD) has emerged as a way to deal with the growing device diversity.\\nRather than building a separate mobile site, your existing design \\u0026ldquo;responds\\u0026rdquo; to device that\\u0026rsquo;s accessing it, adjusting to accomodate the user. Content shifts and flows. On a small screen, the site may be a single column. On a big desktop monitor or TV, it can be many columns wide. On tablets, somewhere in between.\\nThe more nitpicky folks in the web community will tell you that Responsive designs need to have fully fluid columns, while fixed-width columns that simply move or stack on top of each other are called Adapative design. It\\u0026rsquo;s generally agreed upon now that Adaptive is a type of RWD.\\nThe goal, however, is always to provide the same content regardless of the device.\\nMobile First is a type of Responsive Web Design Responsive Web Design isn\\u0026rsquo;t always mobile first, but Mobile First is always Responsive.\\nMany RWD approaches use what\\u0026rsquo;s known as graceful degradation. With this approach, you build your normal \\u0026ldquo;desktop first\\u0026rdquo; design (often a 960 pixel or so grid), and then use media queries to set maximum widths below which content shifts and reflows. The previous layout for this site used that approach.\\nThe problem with this approach is that not all mobile devices are smart phones. They\\u0026rsquo;re not all very fast or capable. They sometimes don\\u0026rsquo;t recognize media queries. And so that beautiful bit of \\u0026ldquo;content choreography\\u0026rdquo; you use for mobile sites? They\\u0026rsquo;re not seeing it.\\nEnter Mobile First.\\nDon't gracefully degrade. Progressively enhance. Mobile First takes the opposite approach of graceful degradation. Instead of building a desktop site and retrofitting it to mobile devices, you build a really simple foundation and then add features for devices that can support them.\\nMobile first sites start with a single column, fully fluid layout and use minimum widths to add columns (instead of maximum widths to take them away). They work on devices that don\\u0026rsquo;t have or support javascript.\\nThey\\u0026rsquo;re not always beautiful, but they\\u0026rsquo;re functional.\\nIt's not just looks You can\\u0026rsquo;t design mobile first without caring about web performance. Your content is being accessed on weak cell phone signals, not just high-speed broadband.\\nSites should be as lightweight and fast as possible. You should combine your javascript and CSS into single files whenever possible. You should use image sprites and icon fonts, smush your image files, and make sensible choices about which file formats to use. You should minify and compress your files.\\nThis doesn\\u0026rsquo;t just benefit your mobile users. It benefits everyone. No one likes a slow website.\\nGetting Started I\\u0026rsquo;ll be honest: I don\\u0026rsquo;t sit down and sketch out the mobile layout before I sketch the desktop layout. It\\u0026rsquo;s more fluid than that.\\nI usually sketch them both out at the same time, and one design feeds the other. But the important thing is that you\\u0026rsquo;re always thinking about how to the design would work on a tiny flip-phone in the middle of the desert.\\nWhen I go to code, I start with the base styles that would apply to a very basic device. That means a single, fluid column with no javascript. On bigger screens, I\\u0026rsquo;ll increase the line height for easier reading. I\\u0026rsquo;ll increase header sizes. I\\u0026rsquo;ll add multiple columns, and functionality for devices that support javascript.\\nTo see a very simple Mobile First site in action, download my Go Mobile First WordPress them and start poking around under the hood.\\n Referenced \\u0026 Useful Resources  How to improve web performance Javascript accessibility The Go Mobile First WordPress theme Using icon fonts The Many Face of Mobile First by Brad Frost The Mobile First book on A Book Apart \",\"summary\":\"Mobile First is starting to achieve a buzzword like status, much in the same way that web 2.0 and HTML5 did.

To help you use it, I\\u0026rsquo;m writing a series of tutorials on how to make some common changes.\\nFor people who are new to web development (or just new to WordPress), I thought I\\u0026rsquo;d start with a brief intro to HTML, CSS and WordPress. A Brief Intro to HTML\\nHTML is like the materials that go into a building.\\nIt\\u0026rsquo;s the content that makes up a webpage, but by itself, it\\u0026rsquo;s mostly without shape or form. You can build a webpage with just HTML and it will be entirely usable\\u0026hellip; though not necessarily all that nice to look at.\\nSimply put, HTML is the content.\\nA Brief Intro to CSS CSS is like the blueprints that tell the construction team (in this case, the web browser) how to assemble the building materials.\\nHow big should the letters be? What about headings? What color are the links? What do they do when you hover over them? Where should this section of content be located, relative to the other pieces of content?\\nIn the earlier days of the web, these instructions were added directly to the content on the page. If you wanted a header to be orange, you would type color=\\u0026ldquo;orange\\u0026rdquo;. As you could imagine, on sites with a lot of content, this was an unrealistic amount of work.\\u0026gt;\\nToday, we use CSS, or cascading style sheets.\\nUsing Stylesheets The \\u0026ldquo;blueprints\\u0026rdquo; for a site are kept in a separate file, and referenced in the header of each page by including something like \\u0026lt;link rel=\\u0026ldquo;stylesheet\\u0026rdquo; type=\\u0026ldquo;text/css\\u0026rdquo; href=\\u0026ldquo;http://your-website.com/assets/stylesheet.css\\u0026quot;\\u0026gt;.\\nIn the stylesheet, you can apply styles to elements directly, for example:\\nh2 { color: orange; } You can also specify classes that get used by multiple HTML elements, such as:\\n.orange { color: orange; } Any element tagged as class=\\u0026ldquo;orange\\u0026rdquo; in your HTML will be orange. You can change .orange to color: blue; in your CSS, and everything with that class in your HTML will now be blue.\\nIDs work similarly, but are applied to just one element, and cannot be reused. For example:\\n#logo { font-size: 24px; } Would make \\u0026lt;h2 id=\\u0026ldquo;logo\\u0026rdquo;\\u0026gt;My Blog\\u0026lt;/h2\\u0026gt; 24 pixels in size. You would not be able to use id=\\u0026ldquo;logo\\u0026rdquo; on any other HTML element.\\nSpecificity \\u0026 the Cascade As the name implies, the styles in a stylesheet cascade. That means that if you write:\\nh2 { color: orange; } h2 { color: blue; } Your h2 elements will be blue. The last specified style takes precedence.\\nTo complicate this slightly, styles that are more specific take precedence, even if they happen earlier in the stylesheet. General elements, like h2 and a, are the least specific, then classes, then IDs.\\nSo this code:\\n.orange { color: orange; } h2 { color: blue; } Would cause \\u0026lt;h2 class=\\u0026ldquo;orange\\u0026rdquo;\\u0026gt; to be orange, because classes are more specific than general elements.\\nTo further complicate things, you can nest elements, classes and IDs (#logo .orange, for example) to provide more specificity. This can cause a world of hurt when things don\\u0026rsquo;t work right and you can\\u0026rsquo;t figure out why, so you should try to write your stylesheets with the least amount of specificity possible.\\nIn Go Mobile First, I only use general HTML elements and classes.\\nA Brief Intro to WordPress If you\\u0026rsquo;re writing a basic HTML webpage, you need to manually code the content on each page.\\nFor content that shared across pages, like navigation links, this is a bit annoying. And if you make an update - for example, adding a new page to your site - you need to manually update the navigation links on every page.\\nWordPress (and other content management systems) provide templates for commonly shared content - the header, footer, blog posts, and so on. Using a programming language called PHP, WordPress pulls page content from a database, adds it to the templates, and compiles it into HTML dynamically when someone tries to access it.\\nThis lets you update shared content once instead of repeatedly.\\nWhat Now? This article is by no means a comprehensive look at HTML, CSS and WordPress. Hopefully, the general concepts here will bring a little clarity to some of the topics and exercises we\\u0026rsquo;ll explore in future tutorials.\\nIf you\\u0026rsquo;re still a little unsure, or would just like to learn more, here are some great resources you should check out:\\n Don't Fear the Internet Team Tree House Dive Into HTML5 \",\"summary\":\"A few weeks ago, I released a free mobile-first starter theme for WordPress called Go Mobile First.

It contains outdated screenshots from the IcoMoon interface, and is not how I build sites today. I\\u0026rsquo;ve since switched to using SVGs, and I\\u0026rsquo;m not looking back. That said, if you\\u0026rsquo;re looking to get started with icon fonts, it\\u0026rsquo;s still a worthwhile read.\\nThis article was updated on August 19, 2013 to reflect the current way I implement icon fonts on my projects, which now includes the use of a feature test.\\nIcon fonts are awesome, and if you\\u0026rsquo;re not already using them on your projects, you should be.\\nIcon fonts are incredibly light weight. The one for this site is just 5kb in size. Because it\\u0026rsquo;s a single font file instead of multiple images, it requires just one HTTP request, which is great for site performance. They can be scaled smoothly to any size, and styled easily using CSS.\\nHere\\u0026rsquo;s how I implement icon fonts on my projects\\u0026hellip; Creating the font\\nThere are a lot of icon fonts available, but I use IcoMoon. The free version contains more than 300 icons, with paid versions offering over 900.\\nMore importantly, though, IcoMoon also offers a free app that lets you build your own custom font. This means you\\u0026rsquo;re only using the icons you need, which keeps the file size down.\\nFull Disclosure: Because I talk about this app so much on Twitter, the guy behind IcoMoon offered me a free upgrade to their Ultimate Pack. I love the app so much that I paid for it anyways, and I had purchased the Essential Pack months ago.\\nTo get started, head over to the IcoMoon app and select the icons you want. When you\\u0026rsquo;re done, click the \\u0026ldquo;Font\\u0026rdquo; button at the bottom of the screen to open the font generator.\\nBefore you download your font, you\\u0026rsquo;ll want to reset the encoding to Private Use Area. This is section of unicode that has not been assigned any characters. Using the private use area for your icons helps ensure that screen readers don\\u0026rsquo;t read them aloud.\\nThe alternative would be to use standard characters (a to z, numbers, etc.). This can cause screen readers to say things like, \\u0026ldquo;z Twitter,\\u0026rdquo; which isn\\u0026rsquo;t good for accessibility.\\nOnce you\\u0026rsquo;ve reset the encoding, click \\u0026ldquo;Download.\\u0026rdquo;\\nAdding the Icons to Your Site When you unzip the download file, you\\u0026rsquo;ll find a few items. The ones we really care about:\\n The font folder. The style.css file.  Upload the files to your site Open up your favorite FTP client, and copy the \\u0026ldquo;fonts\\u0026rdquo; folder into the same directory as your CSS file. If you need to put it somewhere else, that\\u0026rsquo;s ok. You\\u0026rsquo;ll just have to change a few lines of code in your CSS file.\\nNow, open up your stylesheet and add a new section for icons.\\nEmbedding the font Open up \\u0026ldquo;style.css.\\u0026rdquo; At the top, you\\u0026rsquo;ll see this code:\\n@font-face { font-family: 'icomoon'; src:url('fonts/icomoon.eot'); src:url('fonts/icomoon.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'), url('fonts/icomoon.svg#icomoon') format('svg'), url('fonts/icomoon.woff') format('woff'), url('fonts/icomoon.ttf') format('truetype'); font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; } This tells browsers where to find the files for the font-family IcoMoon, and what the default style and weight are.\\nYou\\u0026rsquo;ll notice there are four different file types listed. Unfortunately (but not surprisingly), not all browsers support the same file type, so it\\u0026rsquo;s necessary to include a few. You\\u0026rsquo;ll also notice that eot is listed twice. This is to fix an issue with older versions of IE (again, big surprise).\\nI prefer to see SVG listed last, as it\\u0026rsquo;s typically a bit bigger than the other filetypes and often not as well hinted. It\\u0026rsquo;s used for iOS, which cannot load any of the other types.\\nAfter moving SVG to the end, your code should like this:\\n@font-face { font-family: 'icomoon'; src:url('fonts/icomoon.eot'); src:url('fonts/icomoon.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'), url('fonts/icomoon.woff') format('woff'), url('fonts/icomoon.ttf') format('truetype'), url('fonts/icomoon.svg#icomoon') format('svg'); font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; } Add it to your CSS file.\\nNote: If you copied the \\u0026ldquo;font\\u0026rdquo; folder to a location other than where your CSS file is located, you\\u0026rsquo;ll need to change the URLs in the @font-face declaration accordingly.\\nUpdate on 5/31/2013: In the comments, Nigel Anderson asked how many of these files are downloaded by the browser (and how that could impact performance). The answer: Browsers only download the first supported file in the list, even if they support more than one file type.\\nCreating a class There are two ways to include an icon font in your HTML. One involves adding data-icon= and then the character for your icon to an HTML object.\\nThe second method, which I prefer, is to assign a class to the icon font. Rather than remembering character values, you can add a Twitter icon, for example, by adding class=\\u0026ldquo;icon-twitter\\u0026rdquo; to an HTML object.\\nIcoMoon gives you the option to use either method, but since the second is easier, let\\u0026rsquo;s use that.\\nYou\\u0026rsquo;ll see the following code in the \\u0026ldquo;style.css\\u0026rdquo; file:\\n/* Use the following CSS code if you want to have a class per icon */ [class*=\\\" icon-\\\"]:before { font-family: 'icomoon'; font-style: normal; speak: none; font-weight: normal; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; } This says that any class that begins with icon- should use the IcoMoon font family, has a style and weight of normal, and should not be read aloud by screen readers.\\nYou\\u0026rsquo;ll notice that it also includes the webkit prefixed font-smoothing property. This improves the clarity of the font. For good measure, I also include a non-prefixed version and text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;, which improves kerning on Firefox and newer version of Internet Explorer.\\nThe final version of your code should look something like this:\\n/* Use the following CSS code if you want to have a class per icon */ [class*=\\\" icon-\\\"]:before { font-family: 'icomoon'; font-style: normal; speak: none; font-weight: normal; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; font-smoothing: antialiased; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; } Copy that into your CSS file below your @font-face declaration.\\nNaming the icons Next, we need to associate the individual icons with their unicode characters. IcoMoon does all of the heavy lifting here, creating human-readable classes for the icons.\\nIn this example, I created a simple font with three icons: Twitter, Facebook, and Dribbble.\\nThe \\u0026ldquo;style.css\\u0026rdquo; file contained this code:\\n.icon-twitter:before { content: \\\"\\\\e000\\\"; } .icon-facebook:before { content: \\\"\\\\e001\\\"; } .icon-dribbble:before { content: \\\"\\\\e002\\\"; } You\\u0026rsquo;ll notice that we\\u0026rsquo;re using the CSS3 :before selector. This inserts the specified content before whatever HTML object the class is applied to. The content property is used to define the unicode character.\\nYou can copy this code directly from \\u0026ldquo;style.css\\u0026rdquo; (without any modifications) into your CSS file.\\nUsing icons in your HTML Now that you\\u0026rsquo;ve done all that, including icons in your HTML is insanely easy.\\nUsing my example font above, if I wanted to include a Twitter icon on my site, I would just add \\u0026lt;i class=\\u0026ldquo;icon-twitter\\u0026rdquo;\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/i\\u0026gt; to my HTML.\\nI use the \\u0026lt;i\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/i\\u0026gt; tags because they\\u0026rsquo;re small, no longer used for italics, and there\\u0026rsquo;s something logical about \\u0026ldquo;i is for icon.\\u0026rdquo; Also, it\\u0026rsquo;s what they do in Twitter Bootstrap.\\nUpdate on 5/24/2013: In the comments, Michael Barrish correctly points out that \\u0026lt;i\\u0026gt; is still a perfectly valid HTML element. What I meant to say was that the newer \\u0026lt;em\\u0026gt; element is the preferred way to italicize, because it carries not just stylistic but semantic meaning. Accordingly, I use \\u0026lt;i\\u0026gt; for my icons.\\nDon\\u0026rsquo;t forget to leave a space between the tag and the supporting text. For example, use:\\n\\u0026lt;i class=\\\"icon-twitter\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/i\\u0026gt; Twitter Not:\\n\\u0026lt;i class=\\\"icon-twitter\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/i\\u0026gt;Twitter Styling icons Because the icons are a font, they will inherit the styling of their parent container by default. However, you can apply additional styling using CSS.\\nFor example, if you wanted all icons to have a shadow, you could add the text-shadow property to class^=\\u0026ldquo;icon-\\u0026rdquo;:before, [class*=\\u0026rdquo; icon-\\u0026ldquo;]:before. You can also add gradients, hover effects, CSS3 transitions and more. One limitation: the icons can only be a single color.\\nI like my social media icons to have branded colors, but still display the default hover behaviors. Here\\u0026rsquo;s the code I would use to achieve that with the Twitter icon:\\na .icon-twitter { color: #41b7d8; } This code says that when a Twitter icon is used in a link, it\\u0026rsquo;s color should be #41b7d8, which is Twitter blue.\\nIn my base CSS, links on hover turn black darken and are underlined. With the code above, the icon would still be underlined, but would be Twitter blue. We can fix this by adding a hover color:\\na .icon-twitter { color: #41b7d8; } a:hover .icon-twitter{ color: #005580; } Branded colors While by no means comprehensive, here\\u0026rsquo;s a list of popular social site colors to get you started.\\n Twitter: #41b7d8 Facebook: #3b5997 Google: #d64937 LinkedIn: #0073b2 Vimeo: #388fc5 Flickr: #ff0084 Pinterest: #cb2027 Skype: #00aff0 RSS: #e0812a  Accessibility considerations Icon fonts are typically not read by screen readers. For accessibility reasons, you should not rely on the icon alone to convey meaning.\\nThere\\u0026rsquo;s a simple CSS class you can use to include supporting text in your HTML but position it off screen. If you wanted to display a Twitter icon, for example, you would use this code:\\nHTML \\u0026lt;i class=\\u0026ldquo;icon-twitter\\u0026rdquo;\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/i\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;span class=\\u0026ldquo;screen-reader\\u0026rdquo;\\u0026gt;Twitter\\u0026lt;/span\\u0026gt;\\nNote: the .screen-reader class was updated on December 12, 2016 to a different technique that works better.\\nCSS\\n/** * Visually hide an element, but leave it available for screen readers * @link https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/dist/css/main.css * @link http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/hiding-content-for-accessibility */ .screen-reader { border: 0; clip: rect(0 0 0 0); height: 1px; margin: -1px; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; position: absolute; white-space: nowrap; width: 1px; } Because the text wrapped in the .screen-reader class is still displayed, screen readers will detect it in the HTML and read it out loud. But because it\\u0026rsquo;s positioned off screen, sighted users will not see it.\\nBrowser support Icon fonts work in Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari and the latest versions of Internet Explorer back. They work in iOS and Android, but not Opera Mini. Strangely, they don\\u0026rsquo;t work in IE9 on Windows Phone 7. This has been fixed in Windows Phone 8.\\nWhile @font-face embedding has been supported since IE 5, the approach detailed in this article uses pseudo selectors to include icons in the HTML, and that\\u0026rsquo;s only supported back to IE 8. IcoMoon includes a JavaScript file named lte-ie7.js that\\u0026rsquo;s supposed to provide support for older browsers, but I\\u0026rsquo;ve never gotten it to work, and several others have mentioned running into issues with it in the comments section.\\nI treat icons as a progressive enhancement, and use a simple feature test to check for support.\\nFeature test Browsers that don\\u0026rsquo;t support @font-face will sometimes display empty boxes where the icons should go. This looks ugly and can sometimes overlap with text, making it difficult to read. I use a simple JavaScript feature test to check for @font-face and pseudo selector support.\\nDownload the script from GitHub and include it in your \\u0026lt;head\\u0026gt; element:\\n\\u0026lt;script src=\\\"font-face-feature-test.js\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/script\\u0026gt; This adds a .font-face class to the \\u0026lt;html\\u0026gt; element when both @font-face and the :before pseudo selector are supported. In my CSS file, I prefix the icon names with that class, so that they\\u0026rsquo;re only activated when a browser has the proper support:\\n.font-face .icon-twitter:before { content: \\\"\\\\e000\\\"; } .font-face .icon-facebook:before { content: \\\"\\\\e001\\\"; } .font-face .icon-dribbble:before { content: \\\"\\\\e002\\\"; } You can also use this class to change what content is displayed based on whether or not the browser supports icon fonts. For example, you might show an icon for supporting browsers, and plain text for older browsers. Here\\u0026rsquo;s an example:\\nHTML:\\n\\u0026lt;span class=\\u0026ldquo;if-font-face\\u0026rdquo;\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;i class=\\u0026ldquo;icon-twitter\\u0026rdquo;\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/i\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;span class=\\u0026ldquo;screen-reader\\u0026rdquo;\\u0026gt;Tweet This\\u0026lt;/span\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/span\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;span class=\\u0026ldquo;no-font-face\\u0026rdquo;\\u0026gt;Tweet This\\u0026lt;/span\\u0026gt;\\nCSS:\\n.if-font-face, .font-face no-font-face { display: none; visiblity: hidden; }\\n.font-face .if-font-face { display: inline; visibility: visible; }\\nUsing icons today Despite these considerations, icon fonts are very well supported, highly-flexible, and ready to be used on web projects today. Their small size and crisp resolution make them a versatile addition to responsive web development.\\nReferenced \\u0026 Useful Resources  IcoMoon Icon Fonts are Awesome by CSS-Tricks Trent Walton on why he switched to icon fonts Typekit on Windows Phone 8 Support \",\"summary\":\"Note: This article is a bit stale.

It can do amazing things.\\nAs the mobile revolution and browser diversity continue to grow, though, your content will increasingly be accessed by devices that have varying levels of support for things like javascript.\\nIf aspects of your site break without javascript support, that\\u0026rsquo;s a problem.\\nOne common example is a collapse widget, often used to hide and expand navigation on smaller screens. These are great, but on browsers without javascript support, a visitor to your site will have no way to access the navigation.\\nFortunately, there\\u0026rsquo;s a simple technique that can fix this.\\nJavascript Conditional Styling In my Go Mobile First theme, I employ a really simple technique that I learned from Brad Frost.\\nIf you\\u0026rsquo;re using jQuery, at the end of your javascript file, add this snippet of code\\u0026hellip;\\n/* ============================================================= * accessibility-styles.js v1.0.0 * Adds 'js' class to body to allow for javascript conditional styling * Ensures accessibility of collapsing menu, etc. on all devices * ============================================================= * Copyright 2012 Brad Frost * http://codepen.io/bradfrost * ============================================================= */ $(function () { $('body').addClass('js'); });  This simply adds the class \\u0026ldquo;js\\u0026rdquo; to the body of every page on your site when jQuery is loaded. The genius in this is that it allows you to make your styling conditional on the presence of javascript.\\nModifying Your CSS Let\\u0026rsquo;s use the collapse widget from Twitter Bootstrap is an example. Here\\u0026rsquo;s what the CSS for that widget normally looks like\\u0026hellip;\\n.collapse { position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; -webkit-transition: height 0.35s ease; -moz-transition: height 0.35s ease; -ms-transition: height 0.35s ease; -o-transition: height 0.35s ease; transition: height 0.35s ease; } .collapse .in { height: auto; } In addition to setting some CSS transitions for when the widget expands and collapses, it also says that by default, the collapsed element should have a height of 0 pixels and no overflow of the contents within. When the collapse widget is activated, the class \\u0026ldquo;in\\u0026rdquo; is added to the div, which sets the height back to auto, so the widget expands.\\nIf javascript isn\\u0026rsquo;t working or supported by the browser, that content\\u0026rsquo;s height stays set to 0 pixels and visitors can\\u0026rsquo;t access it.\\nHere\\u0026rsquo;s the fix\\u0026hellip;\\n.js .collapse { position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; -webkit-transition: height 0.35s ease; -moz-transition: height 0.35s ease; -ms-transition: height 0.35s ease; -o-transition: height 0.35s ease; transition: height 0.35s ease; } .collapse .in { height: auto; } This says that when the class \\u0026ldquo;js\\u0026rdquo; is present, set the height to 0 pixels with no overflow. Since the \\u0026ldquo;js\\u0026rdquo; class is applied by javascript, it can only exist if javascript is supported.\\nBy simply adding three characters to your CSS file, you prevent collapse content from being hidden when javascript isn\\u0026rsquo;t available.\\nApplying This Elsewhere This is just one simple example.\\nI use this trick to change the styling of my navigation. When javascript is available, not only do I offer a collapsing menu, but the menu items go from an inline list to stacked block elements. If there\\u0026rsquo;s no javascript, they stay inline.\\nThere\\u0026rsquo;s many ways you can use this. Have fun!\\n\",\"summary\":\"Javascript is like magic pixie dust for the internet. It can do amazing things.\\nAs the mobile revolution and browser diversity continue to grow, though, your content will increasingly be accessed by devices that have varying levels of support for things like javascript.\\nIf aspects of your site break without javascript support, that\\u0026rsquo;s a problem.\\nOne common example is a collapse widget, often used to hide and expand navigation on smaller screens.\",\"title\":\"Accessible Javascript\",\"url\":\"https://gomakethings.com/accessible-javascript/\"},{\"categories\":[\"Code\",\"Technology\"],\"content\":\"Last week, I pushed out an update to the Web App Starter Kit.\\nWhat's New in Version 2?

Competition followed with their own implementations of the touch screen phone, which has now led to a healthy competitive marketplace with plenty of great products for the consumer to pick from. Apple were the first to come up with the iPhone style design, but we’re no worse for having others follow it. Indeed, we’d be worse off if the rest kept their old, clunky designs. Dmitry\\u0026rsquo;s thoughtful pieces explores the inspiration versus copying. Apple products, for example, are openly inspired by much of Dieter Ram\\u0026rsquo;s work with Braun. But they\\u0026rsquo;re not copies. Apple isn\\u0026rsquo;t making electric razors.\\nDmitry argues that copying dilutes brands and makes it hard for consumers to tell the difference. I can see that, but I also feel like the copycat products are copies are the superficial level only.\\nRounded corners, a chicklet keyboard and a solid aluminum body aren\\u0026rsquo;t what makes a Macbook a Macbook (well not entirely, anyways). It\\u0026rsquo;s the way to software and hardware work together. The 6 hours of battery life. The backlit keys. The attention to every little detail.\\nCreativity is about copying ideas, transforming them, and combining into something new. Apple is great at that. Where I think most critics get hung up on how Samsung and others do it is that they nail the first part - the copying - but maybe aren\\u0026rsquo;t so good at putting their own spin on things.\\n\",\"summary\":\"Dmitry Fadeyev on innovation, brand dilution and copycats\\u0026hellip;\\nTake Apple’s iPhone for example.

One important explanation is due to what I call \\\"the clarity paradox,\\\" which can be summed up in four predictable phases: Phase 1: When we really have clarity of purpose, it leads to success. Phase 2: When we have success, it leads to more options and opportunities. Phase 3: When we have increased options and opportunities, it leads to diffused efforts. Phase 4: Diffused efforts undermine the very clarity that led to our success in the first place. Curiously, and overstating the point in order to make it, success is a catalyst for failure. I see this personally at work, too. When you do something really well, people wonder what you\\u0026rsquo;ll do next.

Passengers were lodging an inordinate number of complaints about the long waits at baggage claim. In response, the executives increased the number of baggage handlers working that shift. The plan worked: the average wait fell to eight minutes, well within industry benchmarks. But the complaints persisted. Puzzled, the airport executives undertook a more careful, on-site analysis. They found that it took passengers a minute to walk from their arrival gates to baggage claim and seven more minutes to get their bags. Roughly 88 percent of their time, in other words, was spent standing around waiting for their bags. So the airport decided on a new approach: instead of reducing wait times, it moved the arrival gates away from the main terminal and routed bags to the outermost carousel. Passengers now had to walk six times longer to get their bags. Complaints dropped to near zero. I find this quirk of human behavior absolutely fascinating, and I can fully relate to it. When stuck in traffic, I\\u0026rsquo;d much rather get off the highway and take the scenic route, which may get me the same time to get where I\\u0026rsquo;m going as if I just stuck it out, simply because I\\u0026rsquo;m moving.\\nBrad Frost recently cited some data claiming that 74 percent of visitors abandon a website if it takes more than 5 seconds to load.

Total time investment: 30 minutes, and the site is noticeably snappier.\\nHere\\u0026rsquo;s what I did\\u0026hellip; Getting Started\\nFirst, there\\u0026rsquo;s a few things you\\u0026rsquo;ll need to do:  Download and install Google Chrome, if you don\\u0026rsquo;t already have it. Install the Page Speed add-on. Backup all of your WordPress files, just in case something goes wrong. \\nMinify Minifying is the process of removing spacing, line breaks and comments from your CSS, HTML, and javascript. Though it might not seem like a big deal, removing all those unused elements can decrease the size of your files by 20 40 percent or more.\\nUnfortunately, it also leaves your code unreadable to humans, but that\\u0026rsquo;s ok. I write and modify my code in human readable format, and then use an app to minify it for me.\\nMinify your CSS In Google Chrome, run the Developer Tools and click on the \\u0026ldquo;Page Speed\\u0026rdquo; tab. Then click \\u0026ldquo;Analyze.\\u0026rdquo;\\nYou\\u0026rsquo;ll be given an overall score, and a list of things you can do to improve your score.\\nOne of the items on the list will be \\u0026ldquo;Minify CSS.\\u0026rdquo; Click it. Under \\u0026ldquo;Suggestions for this page\\u0026rdquo; is a link to \\u0026ldquo;see optimized content.\\u0026rdquo; Follow that to get a minified version of your CSS provided by Google.\\nI created a copy of my stylesheet, removed the header information, and renamed it \\u0026ldquo;style-unmin.css.\\u0026rdquo; This is the human readable file I\\u0026rsquo;ll now edit when I need to update my site. Without the header info, it just sits on the server.\\nThen I went to my active stylesheet, and pasted in the minified CSS provided by Google. When you do this, make sure you leave the header information (theme name, etc.) intact or Wordpress won\\u0026rsquo;t be able to access your theme.\\nClick \\u0026ldquo;Update\\u0026rdquo; and you\\u0026rsquo;re done. Easy, right?\\nMinify your javascript In the Developer Tools Window, click on \\u0026ldquo;Minify Javascript\\u0026rdquo; and repeat the process above to access a minified version of your script from Google. If you\\u0026rsquo;re using jQuery, Google also provides a minified version of that you can use.\\nI created a new file called \\u0026ldquo;js-min.js\\u0026rdquo; and dropped the minified code into that. Then I changed the link in my footer to point to the new javascript file. (You do call your javascript in your footer for better performance, right?)\\nAnd again, you\\u0026rsquo;re done.\\nMinify your HTML Because your HTML is server up dynamically using PHP, minifying your HTML requires you to add a few lines of code to your functions file in Wordpress.\\nBetween \\u0026lt;?php and ?\\u0026gt; add this bit of code (txt file), courtesy of DVS. (If you\\u0026rsquo;d prefer to use a plugin, I threw one together. Download it here.)\\nThis tells WordPress to remove the spaces and comments from your HTML and inline CSS and javascript. If you view source after making this update, you\\u0026rsquo;ll see a message at the bottom of the page telling you how much the file was compressed.\\nOne issue I have discovered: If you use inline AJAX, this code may prevent it from working properly. If you find this to be the case, set protected $compress_js = true; to false instead, and it will leave javascript uncompressed.\\nAnd you\\u0026rsquo;re done.\\nCompress With a simple modification to your .htaccess file, you can tell the server your WordPress site sits on to send your files compressed as gzip files. This reduces file size by about 70 percent, which can make a huge difference, especially for people browsing on low bandwidth devices.\\nUnderneath your WordPress stuff, add this bit of code courtesy of Dave Rupert:\\n#Specify Font Types AddType font/ttf .ttf AddType font/otf .otf AddType application/x-woff .woff AddType image/svg+xml .svg AddType application/vnd.ms-fontobject .eot # Enable GZIP \\u0026lt;ifmodule mod_deflate.c\\u0026gt; AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/text text/html text/plain text/xml text/css font/ttf font/otf image/svg+xml application/vnd.ms-fontobject application/x-javascript application/javascript BrowserMatch ^Mozilla/4 gzip-only-text/html BrowserMatch ^Mozilla/4.0[678] no-gzip BrowserMatch bMSIE !no-gzip !gzip-only-text/html \\u0026lt;/ifmodule\\u0026gt; For browsers that will support it, your files should now get gzipped by the server prior to being sent.

This makes the file sizes up to 30 60 percent bigger than they need to be.\\n\\u0026ldquo;Smushing\\u0026rdquo; images is the process of removing that unneeded data and optimizing them for web viewing.\\nDave recommends going back and smushing all of the old images on your site. I was far too lazy for that. Instead, I simply optimized the photo on my Info page, and will be smushing all photos I post on the site going forward.\\nSmushing Apps So how exactly do you smush an image? There\\u0026rsquo;s an app for that!\\nI downloaded ImageOptim, which is unfortunately Mac only. It\\u0026rsquo;s a simple drag-and-drop application, and actually shows you how much smaller the file is after smushing.\\nIf you\\u0026rsquo;re on a PC, you can also use Smush.it, a web-based app from Yahoo.\\nBetter file types It\\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that I\\u0026rsquo;m not just smushing my images, but also making smarter decisions about file types.\\nHistorically, I would save all of my images as PNGs files. PNG is a lossless image format, so it keeps graphics sharp and crisp (as opposed to the lossy JPG format). However, PNGs are also substantially larger than JPGs.\\nFor icons, PNGs make a lot of sense (or used to - more on that in a minute). But for something like a photo of people or places, which already have a lot of noise in them, a JPG is actually a better format because it\\u0026rsquo;s much smaller in size.\\nFonts, not images I had already done this a while ago, but rather than using PNGs for my icons, I actually use an embedded web font.\\nUsing the IcoMoon app, I was able to create a custom font set with just the icons I need. It weighs in at just 8 kb for most file types and results in just a single HTTP request, which drastically improves performance.\\nAnd because I\\u0026rsquo;m loading a font and not images, my icons don\\u0026rsquo;t get distorted on retina displays. If you don\\u0026rsquo;t go the icon font route, you should use image sprites instead.\\nWhat I didn't do Dave recommends one additional thing that I haven\\u0026rsquo;t done: Install WP Super Cache.\\nIn simple terms, when a user visits your site, WordPress compiles your content from the database with the content from your theme and serves up a webpage. WP Super Cache converts your pages into cached static HTML pages ahead of time, reducing load time by cutting the database out of the process.\\nI\\u0026rsquo;ll probably get around to adding this at some point down the road.\\nReferenced \\u0026 Useful Resources  Web Performant Wordpress by Dave Rupert.

Even with the promise that the less privileged might get a chance to show up later, you’re making a fundamentally unfair system. On one hand, yes, the beauty of the web is that it\\u0026rsquo;s open and inclusive. But I\\u0026rsquo;m actually more intrigued by it\\u0026rsquo;s ability to connect people who otherwise would not have met - which is something a bit different from being open.\\nSometimes a gated community is nice. It keeps the signal high and the noise low, which actually allows for better, more meaningful connections. The Beauty of Paid Services\\nTwitter today is filled with sponsored tweets, countless spammers, and people who shout loudly but never listen. That\\u0026rsquo;s the downside of free and open. Your party inevitably has a lot of crashers.\\nA paid service creates a barrier to entry that keeps a lot of that garbage out. It also helps ensure a more stable long-term business.\\nDalton Caldwell, who\\u0026rsquo;s the guy behind App.net, writing about what Twitter could have been, said\\u0026hellip;\\nWhen Twitter started to get traction, a year or two into their existence, I decided that Twitter was the Best Thing Ever. I realized that Twitter, because of their API, actually was a real-time protocol to connect various services in a novel way. I had debates with my other tech-nerd friends about whether Twitter could be one of the fundamental building blocks of the Internet via their powerful API. When reporters or investors asked me what I thought the most exciting company in the valley was, I would invariably answer “Twitter”. As I understand, a hugely divisive internal debate occurred among Twitter employees around this time. One camp wanted to build the entire business around their realtime API. In this scenario, Twitter would have turned into something like a realtime cloud API company. The other camp looked at Google’s advertising model for inspiration, and decided that building their own version of AdWords would be the right way to go. And you know who won: The ads people.\\nIf your business depends on advertising, your business model is all about growth of your own network. You need people to spend increasingly larger amounts of time on your app sharing increasingly large quantities of information.\\nQuantity. Not quality.\\nAn Alternative to Ads But there\\u0026rsquo;s another way.\\nIn a follow-up post, Dalton describes the success of GitHub\\u0026hellip;\\nYears later a site called Github came out. It was good. They had no advertising, but charged money for certain features. They quickly became profitable because the service was so good and so important, people were willing to pay. Github has become a much-loved brand and service, and many would agree that it is a key piece of infrastructure in the technical renaissance we are currently experiencing. Github is apparently profitable, and it sounds like the people that work there spend their time trying to make the best service possible, as opposed to spending their time trying to extract additional pennies out of their users. This model frees you up to make far better decisions about things. You don\\u0026rsquo;t need to make decisions solely on driving users to consume more. They can consume better.\\nIs Paid Exclusionary? Some folks, like Anil Dash or Tess Rinearson, see this as a exclusionary and elitist. Tess wonders if App.net is the country club of the internet\\u0026hellip;\\n[I]t’s not yet clear exactly what App.net’s subscription fee will be. But even a very low fee could prove prohibitive for a large segment of the web. And even if it doesn’t, the appeal of this new network seems limited to a specific demographic, at least for now: All of my friends who have backed the site are both white and male. Of course, pockets and bubbles have existed and will always exist on the internet. But it scares me when people start imagining a site like App.net asThe Future of Social Networks, and herald it for its ability to keep “unwanted” people out. So yea, that\\u0026rsquo;s one way to think about it. But another is that being user funded from day one gives you the freedom to make far better decisions about your business.\\nJason Fried of 37Signals talks about this all the time. In an article for Inc. Magazine, he wrote\\u0026hellip;\\nWhen you put a price on something, you get really honest feedback from customers. When entrepreneurs ask me how to get customers to tell us what they really think, I respond with two words: Charge them. They'll tell you what they think, demand excellence, and take the product seriously in a way they never would if they were just using it for free. The Echo Chamber Tess may be on to something when she writes\\u0026hellip;\\nHacker News is filled with people who are startup literate and technically competent. People write grammatical arguments and share deep knowledge. Hacker News is The Place where “startup people” congregate. It’s also boring as hell. It’s an echo chamber, a bubble. Everyone has the same interests, and many people come from similar backgrounds. It’s hive-mind-y. I post there, and I contribute, but it’s not as interesting as a discussion on, say, Twitter. Twitter has a diverse user base and generally welcoming approach, and it shows. But the echo chamber exists on open and free sites like Twitter, too. People tend to follow people who think and act like they do.\\nThere's a duality to the internet It\\u0026rsquo;s open and free and connects people around the world. But it also costs money. Computers cost money. Servers cost money. Infrastructure costs money. Apps may only cost time to build, but they cost money to run.\\nI believe in an open and egalitarian web, but I don\\u0026rsquo;t believe that means there\\u0026rsquo;s not room for paid and exclusive products.\\nTo use hardware as an analogy: You can buy an inexpensive mobile phone, a cheap netbook, a mid-range Dell, or a high-end MacBook Pro. The experience of using the web on each of those will vary differently.\\nThe web is not short of social networks. You have free options, and you have paid options. Most of the information on paid sites can be found elsewhere, too. But you have to sort through a lot more noise to find that signal.\\nAnd that\\u0026rsquo;s the power of paid services.

It\\u0026rsquo;s not the typeface that\\u0026rsquo;s the problem - it\\u0026rsquo;s how you use it.\\nComic Sans is actually a great choice for comic books (which is what it was actually modeled after). Financial communications? Not so much.\\nType is a beautiful group of letters, not a group of beautiful letters. Typography isn\\u0026rsquo;t just about choosing a pretty font. It\\u0026rsquo;s about the relationship of the letters with each other to form words, sentences and paragraphs.\\nMost information is in the top half of a letter. There\\u0026rsquo;s one part in the video where Jason covers up the bottom half of a sentence, and you can still read the sentence easily. Then he covers up the top half, and it becomes completely unreadable.\\nMost of the information a letter conveys occurs in the top half. Who knew?\\nSome basic principles...  Achieve hierarchy through contrast. Big vs. small. Bold and italic vs. regular. It's better to set type too big than too small. Unfortunately, far too many websites are set too small for today's high resolution screens. In most cases, use 16 pixels as a minimum. Longer line length requires more line spacing. That is all.  What are my working typefaces? Near the end of his talk, Jason mentions that some of the best designers have built their careers using just a small collection of working types.\\n(Working types are typefaces that work well in a range of sizes and applications.)\\nJason argues that there\\u0026rsquo;s a real value spending time getting to know a typeface really well - in learning it\\u0026rsquo;s quirks and understanding it\\u0026rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses.

The Why\\nIn a word, Instapaper.\\nOnce you get used to reading articles in Instapaper, you gain a much deeper appreciation for good typography - large font sizes, well spaced and measured lines, and beautiful typefaces. And you start to realize how much reading on a typical webpage actually sucks.\\nI\\u0026rsquo;d like to think Go Make Things was actually a pretty good reading experience already, but typography was not something I\\u0026rsquo;d spent much time thinking about.\\nFor this experiment, I wanted to start with typography first, and build a web experience around that.\\nThe How As far as typefaces go, Georgia holds a special place in my heart.\\nEven when Instapaper released their recent update with a variety of new and beautiful fonts, I stuck with Georgia. It\\u0026rsquo;s the font I use in iBooks and my mobile RSS reader, too. It\\u0026rsquo;s incredible readable, even at smaller sizes.\\nSo when I went to choose a primary typeface, Georgia was my first choice.\\nSetting the Size I spent a few weeks experimenting with Georgia in various font sizes on my laptop, my iPhone and my iPad.\\nI wanted to a size that would be highly readable on both a standard resolution computer screen and high resolution Retina displays. A 16 pixel font size looks normal on a computer but too small on a Retina display. At 18 pixels, Georgia is beautiful on Retina but too big for the desktop.\\nWhile I\\u0026rsquo;m not wild about odd numbers, 17 pixels turned out to be just right for both.\\nSetting the Width \\u0026 Line Height After experimenting with a variety of line-lengths, somewhere around 85 characters-per-line turned out to be the most comfortable for long-form reading. That works out to 640 pixels wide for a 17 pixel font size.\\nI used Chris Pearson\\u0026rsquo;s Golden Ratio Typography calculator to determine my line height, which came out to 26 pixels.\\n(Chris\\u0026rsquo;s calculator is a great tool - I\\u0026rsquo;ll definitely be using this on all of my projects going forward!)\\nCreating a Typographic Scale In the past, I\\u0026rsquo;ve always just arbitrarily picked sizes for my headers and meta information, experimenting until I found something that \\u0026ldquo;looked right.\\u0026rdquo;\\nHowever, typographers have literally spent hundreds of years perfecting the art of the typographic scale. This time, I wanted to use their methods to great a more visually pleasing scale.\\nFortunately, Ian Lamb\\u0026rsquo;s Typograph app did all the heavy lifting. You enter your font size and line height, and select your desired scale (in this case, Traditional). The app provides you with a scale in pixels, ems and points.\\nThis scale became the basis for every header, margin, list, and piece of text on the site. The one exception: headers are set with a line-height of 1.2 ems.\\nAdding the Details At this point, I had a layout that was very readable but not terribly distinctive.\\n(Ok, if I\\u0026rsquo;m being honest, the process was far less linear, with lots of experimenting. I would add some branding details, tweak the typography, and repeat iteratively.)\\nI repurposed the branding from my previous layout, using the same colors for the header, links and footer. And while I made some minor tweaks to quote formatting and the comments section, the branding is largely the same.\\nDropping the Sidebar I decided at the very beginning of this experiment to remove the sidebar.\\nI\\u0026rsquo;ve gotten used to reading on my phone and iPad, where sites are often displayed as single column. I like the experience so much, I wanted to use it as the default for the redesigned Go Make Things.\\nLet\\u0026rsquo;s be honest: there\\u0026rsquo;s usually nothing all that important in the sidebar, anyways.\\nAdding Responsive Web Design Normally, responsive design is something I build in from the very start. However, because this is a single column layout, there weren\\u0026rsquo;t many considerations in the way of reflowing a grid.\\nThis is, in fact, the easiest responsive site I\\u0026rsquo;ve ever built. I made just a handful of small adjustments:\\n I changed the main container div from width: 640px; to max-width: 640px;. This causes the site to fluidly resize itself on smaller screens. (Max-width isn't supported by IE6, but the browser is now more than ten years old, and I'm not longer supporting it for this site.) I decreased the line height to 25 pixels for screens below 640 pixels (again, using the Golden Ratio Typography calculator to determine the right line height for smaller site widths). I decreased the left margin on lists on quotes for improved readability on smaller screens. I decreased the font size of H1 and H2 headers on smaller screens, keeping them within the typographic scale. I set form inputs to span the full width of the screen on smaller devices.  And that\\u0026rsquo;s pretty much it.\\nLearn More  The Ultimate Guide to Readable Web Typography by Chris Pearson.

Rather than going from wireframe to full Photoshop mockup, designers are going from rough sketch to working HTML prototype.)\\nA Required Skill Mobile traffic is rapidly overtaking desktop traffic. Building a site that looks good on small screens will be a must-have, not a nice-to-have.\\nI suspect that as our industry matures and our workflows change to accomodate responsive design, the amount of work it takes to complete responsive web projects will decrease, and pricing will fall more in line with where it ultimately should be.\\nWhat do you think?

How do you encourage people to hang out and interact?\\nNotes \\u0026 Further Reading  This post was inspired by Design Patterns: When Breaking the Rules is Ok: http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2012/06/06/design-patterns-when-breaking-rules-ok/ Christopher Alexander's A Pattern Language: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language  \",\"summary\":\"From Christopher Alexander\\u0026rsquo;s A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction, a book on architecture published in 1977\\u0026hellip;\\nThe street cafe provides a unique setting, special to cities: a place where people can sit lazily, legitimately, be on view, and watch the world go by. Therefore: encourage local cafes to spring up in each neighborhood.

It sucked.\\nOne of the biggest blessings of the internet, however, is also one of it\\u0026rsquo;s biggest pain points. A fragmented reading experience\\nInline citations have a nasty habit of fragmenting a reading experience.\\nRob Friesel Jr. explains\\u0026hellip;\\nLinks break the linearity of a given text, creating recognizably actionable opportunities for the reader to “move beyond” the text, onward to whatever it references. If a reader interprets the link as being an urgent call to action, then the reader is going to click the link, follow it, experience a context shift (i.e., navigating from one page/site to an entirely different page/site), and then have to decide whether to consume that new content (i.e., read that page) or navigate back or dive further down the rabbit hole. (Rob actually concludes that this isn\\u0026rsquo;t necessarily the case on the web, and his post is worth reading in full.)\\nThere have been a few studies (the links to which I unfortunately do not have) that have shown that retention of information is worse with inline links and citations than with uninterrupted blocks of text.\\nAn argument for inline links I tend to journey down the rabbit hole in one of two ways.\\nSometimes, I read an article in full, opening links in new tabs so I can read them later. Other times, I\\u0026rsquo;ll read them on the spot to provide me with additional background information before proceeding.\\nThe traditional footnote approach works great for the first use case, but for the second, inline citation is far more useful.\\nI\\u0026rsquo;m not sure it\\u0026rsquo;s my job, as an author to decide which use case is more appropriate for my readers. The needs of any given reader will vary based on past experience and exposure to concepts, learning need, and so on.\\nWhat to do?\\nA hybrid approach A few weeks ago, I stumbled upon a website (that I again lost the link to) that took a hybrid approach. Rather than using just footnotes or inline links, it used both. For every link.\\nIt was surprisingly awesome.\\nIn the body of the text, references were linked as normal. At the end of each post was a list of referenced stuff, all in one spot, for additional or later reading. Perhaps not the most elegant solution, but certainly the most simple.\\nI\\u0026rsquo;ll be experimenting with that approach here, but I\\u0026rsquo;m curious to hear what you think.\\nFootnotes  \\\"Journey down the rabbit hole\\\" is a reference to Alice in Wonderland: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland On footnotes, links and cognition: http://blog.founddrama.net/2011/01/on-footnotes-links-and-cognition/ \",\"summary\":\"One of the greatest joys of using the internet is the \\u0026ldquo;journey down the rabbit hole\\u0026rdquo; - the serendipitous learning that occurs as you follow one link after another.\\nIt\\u0026rsquo;s unexpected, surprising, frustrating and exciting.\\nIf you\\u0026rsquo;re old enough, you may remember having to cross-reference citations against footnotes, and using a complicated sorting system to physically locate source material.

If it \\\"makes sense,\\\" just more of the familiar. Success per me: Be un-careful of who you listen to. I actually think Tom and I were talking about two different things: Diversity of conversation, and quantity of conversation. Diversity vs. Quantity\\nBack in January, one of the goals I set for myself was to read more diversely, but subscribe to fewer blogs overall. I see my approach on Twitter as an extension of this.\\nTo Tom\\u0026rsquo;s point, diversity of conversation is critically important. Particularly online, there\\u0026rsquo;s a bit of an echo-chamber effect that can happen pretty quickly. You follow people who you find interesting, they have similar perspectives as you, and soon you\\u0026rsquo;re in this self-reinforcing bubble of awesome.\\nTo counteract that, you should try to follow and have conversations with people who think differently from you. It helps you think more critically and be more creative.\\nHowever, there\\u0026rsquo;s a massive noise-to-signal ratio in social media. If you follow more than one or two hundred people, you end up a missing a lot of good stuff hidden in all the noise.\\nSocial Pruning Every six months or so I prune the list of people I follow on Twitter and Facebook. I\\u0026rsquo;ll often add some new people, and remove a bunch more.\\nEvery time I do this, I start seeing more posts from people that I had been missing.\\nThe depth, diversity and meaningfulness of conversation goes way up. Learning goes way up. Engagement and interaction goes way up.\\nI believe that if you want to have better conversations online, it\\u0026rsquo;s not enough to just expose yourself to diverse inputs. You need to be more present and engaged. You need to go deeper.\\nAnd I don\\u0026rsquo;t think you can do that when you\\u0026rsquo;re following too many people. Then it just becomes a game of soundbites.\\nNoteworthy Reactions At the start of the year, I cut back on the amount of people I followed on social networks, to be under 150, based on Dunbar’s number of stable social relationships one can maintain. I’ve tried to ensure that some of those people are “connectors” who will refer me to other interesting things from their networks. I certainly don’t feel that I’ve lost out, if anything I think I need to cut more! - Adam Axon Footnotes  Tom Peters on Twitter: http://twitter.com/#!/tom_peters My Goals for 2012: https://gomakethings.com/my-goal-for-the-new-year/ \",\"summary\":\"I had an interesting conversation with Tom Peters last week after mentioning that I only follow about 40 or so people on Twitter.\\nTom: I follow people who say interesting things or have interesting backgrounds. 41 \\\"worthy people\\\" is nuts - to me.

The Every Time Zone app is just a list of locations and their current times and dates. You can adjust your local time, but that\\u0026rsquo;s about it.\\nYou could argue that apps provide utility, which is what differentiates them from websites.

Meanwhile, an app like Angry Birds provides heaps of fun, but that\\u0026rsquo;s not the same as utility.\\nWhat do you think the difference between an app and a website is?\\nNoteworthy Reactions An app is like an ATM – it allows me to replicate some (or all) of the functionality of the bank retail environment where ever (almost where ever) I am.

Gedit Gedit is my go to editor. I know there are a handful of wonderful options out there, but Gedit is free and cross-OS. It features line-wrapping and a highlighting system that makes it much easier to read my code.\\n2. Kuler Kuler is a fantastic (and free!) resource from Adobe that makes creating a color palette much less painful. With Kuler, you can upload images and extract colors from them. I love using photos I\\u0026rsquo;ve taken as inspiration for my palettes.\\nKuler can also create a palette for you from a base color using color theory. Find complementary colors, monochromatic themes, shades and more with a single click. Kuler provides RGB, CMYK, hex and more!\\n3. PowerPoint, Keynote or Open Office Nowadays I typically go from rough paper sketch straight to HTML, but if I do wireframe or create a comp, I create it in PowerPoint.\\nIt\\u0026rsquo;s fast and efficient, and if you can create it in PowerPoint, you can create it in HTML.\\n4. ConvertICO.com Together with PowerPoint, simply the easiest way to create favicons.\\nFonts 5. Font Squirrel Font Squirrel rocks for two reasons. First, they\\u0026rsquo;ve got an awesome collection of free, commercial use fonts. I\\u0026rsquo;m not saying there aren\\u0026rsquo;t any bad fonts there - there are - but there\\u0026rsquo;s a much higher density of quality ones, too.\\nFont Squirrel also has an amazing @font-face generator that will turn your web-licensed font into a complete kit ready for embedding on the web.\\n6. IcoMoon IcoMoon is a very cool web app you can use to build customized icon fonts. Image icons often look terrible on the new iPad\\u0026rsquo;s retina display. The icons generated by IcoMoon are actually a font set, so they look great no matter how big or small they are, even on a retina display.\\nBecause you can create a font set with just the icons you need, the embedded font set is small and easy for browsers to download. And because it\\u0026rsquo;s a font, you can control icon styling using CSS!\\n7. The Font Matrix Richard Rutter has created a regularly updated matrix detailing which fonts are available on what operating systems. A great tool when to have when you\\u0026rsquo;re putting together font stacks.\\n8. Revised Font Stacks Amrinder Sandhu provides a thoughtful list of essential font stacks, based on font-share statistics and typographical similarities. If I\\u0026rsquo;m being honest, I\\u0026rsquo;m more likely to use this list than I am the font matrix.\\n9. What font? Ever fall in love with a font on someone\\u0026rsquo;s website and wonder what it was? The \\u0026ldquo;What font?\\u0026rdquo; bookmarklet will tell you the font stack, size, line height and color.\\nTesting 10. Responsive Web Design Test Page This handy bookmarklet loads your website in a series of iframes of different dimensions. While it\\u0026rsquo;s no replacement for true cross-device testing, it\\u0026rsquo;s a great way to quickly see how your site will look on a variety of screens.\\n11. IE Tester Unfortunately this freeware requires Windows, so I have to boot it up on my virtual machine, but it simulates browsing on every version of IE from 5 through 10 beta. It\\u0026rsquo;s a quick and easy way to test a myriad of Internet Explorer versions.\\nHat tip to Chris Coyier of CSS Tricks for this one.\\n12. Color Oracle Ever wonder what your site looks like to someone who\\u0026rsquo;s color blind? How easy to see are those links?\\nAccessibility matters. Color Oracle simulates the appearance of your website to someone with a few types of color blindness. A must-have for the modern web designer\\u0026rsquo;s toolkit.\\nHat tip to Andy Rutledge.\\nFrameworks 13. Meyer's CSS Reset and Normalize.css There\\u0026rsquo;s an ongoing debate in the web design community over whether you should use a reset (which resets a variety of elements across browsers), normalize (which instead attempts to ensure cross-browser consistency), or nothing but smarter css choices.\\nI currently use a modified version of Meyer\\u0026rsquo;s CSS Reset that combines just a couple of more useful elements from Normalize. Here\\u0026rsquo;s the code I use\\u0026hellip;\\n/* Resets everything */ html, body, div, span, applet, object, iframe, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, blockquote, pre, a, abbr, acronym, address, big, cite, code, del, dfn, em, img, ins, kbd, q, s, samp, small, strike, strong, sub, sup, tt, var, b, u, i, center, dl, dt, dd, ol, ul, li, fieldset, form, label, legend, table, caption, tbody, tfoot, thead, tr, th, td, article, aside, canvas, details, embed, figure, figcaption, footer, header, hgroup, menu, nav, output, ruby, section, summary, time, mark, audio, video { margin: 0; padding: 0; border: 0; font-family: \\\"Helvetica Neue\\\", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 100%; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; } /* Helps older browsers recognize new HTML5 semantics */ article, aside, details, figcaption, figure, footer, header, hgroup, menu, nav, section { display: block; } /* Forces a scrollbar on short pages to avoid jumpy looking pages.

Bootstrap Bootstrap is a massive web app framework from the fine folks of Twitter. It uses a 12 column, 960 pixel grid, and comes with built-in responsive design, a massive library of CSS and javascript functionality, and a cool assortment of icons.\\nI rarely use something like this, just because it\\u0026rsquo;s so big and bloated for what I normally need. But I did Bootstrap to build an internal web app recently, and it sped up development time by quite a bit.\\n15. Go Code Things If you\\u0026rsquo;re new to web design, Go Code Things is a free WordPress theme I created to teach beginners how to build websites. Almost every line of CSS and HTML are document within the code itself, so you can learn by doing.\\nIt\\u0026rsquo;s a responsive layout built on HTML5 and CSS3, and comes with a simple icon pack to get you started.\\nLearning 16. A Practical Guide to Designing for the Web If you\\u0026rsquo;ve been doing this a long time, you might not get as much out of this book, but Designing for the Web by Mark Boulton is a great primer on all things graphic design for the web.\\nMark covers grid-based layouts, typography, color theory and more. A lot of this information can be found on Mark\\u0026rsquo;s blog, but having it all in a single resource is awesome.\\n17. Design View and Design Professionalism These two websites, both by Andy Rutledge, could easily fill up a week of reading. In fact, I actually read everything posted on both of them while I was on vacation a few months ago.\\nIf you\\u0026rsquo;re truly in the design business, whether working for yourself, at an agency, or as an in-house designer in a company, Andy\\u0026rsquo;s articles are a must read.\\nBonus: 18. Dive Into HTML5 If you\\u0026rsquo;re unfamiliar with HTML5, and looking to get started, this comprehensive book by Mark Pilgram is available in its entirety for free online. It\\u0026rsquo;s written in (mostly) plain English, and provides a really nice overview of what\\u0026rsquo;s new, what\\u0026rsquo;s not, and how to get started.\\nConclusion In addition to everything listed above, my favorite set of tools are a pen and a sheet of paper.

And because it\\u0026rsquo;s a single file weighing in at just 8kb (for most filetypes), it\\u0026rsquo;s fast and easy for browsers to download, and only requires one HTTP request.\\nIcoMoon fonts are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike.\\nButtons anywhere! Add buttons anywhere on your site by adding the class .btn to links, divs and more. To make a button larger, also add the class .large-btn.\\nFor example, a large button like the one at the top of this page would be written as:\\n\\u0026lt;a href=\\\"#\\\" class=\\\"btn btn-large\\\"\\u0026gt;Button Text\\u0026lt;/a\\u0026gt; This technique was adapted from the Twitter Bootstrap framework.\\nBuilt-in social sharing Social sharing buttons are built-in for Twitter and Facebook. They take advantage of the icon font set and button class, so they can be highly customized, placed anywhere, and look amazing on retina displays. Thanks to a snippet of javascript, social sharing links open in a pop-up window on desktops.\\nYou can add additional links using the built-in icon set. To turn a link into a social sharing button, use the .btn-sm class. Do not include .btn or .btn-large.\\nForms \\u0026 Tables Go Code Things includes basic form styling for search boxes, comment forms, and \\u0026ldquo;subscribe by email\\u0026rdquo; buttons. If you\\u0026rsquo;re looking for more robust forms, you may want to check out Twitter Bootstrap.\\nAlso included is styling for simple, bordered, condensed and striped tables. This code was shamelessly borrowed from the Twitter Bootstrap framework. Click here to see it in action.\\nWhat's not included? Go Code Things is intentionally simple. It does not include lots of components and cool javascript like a some frameworks do. That means it doesn\\u0026rsquo;t have things like drop-down menus, modals or tabs. If you\\u0026rsquo;re looking for something more robust, Twitter Bootstrap is an amazing framework with pretty much everything you could ever want in a framework (except the built-in documentation).\\nThis theme, like WordPress, is licensed under the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation.

It\\u0026rsquo;s my go-to device for reading on the web, and whether it\\u0026rsquo;s my RSS reader, stuff saved in Instapaper, or an actual website, reading on the iPad is like flipping through a magazine.\\nTouching, sliding, and flipping as a way to interact with content just feels intuitive, much more so than clicking and dragging a mouse and cursor.\\nI find myself using my laptop and phone less and less, and my iPad more and more. For heavy lifting - drafting proper emails, editing videos and such - I still turn to my laptop. But I can envision that changing as time goes on.\\nCreating with your hands rather than with a mouse is an inevitable return to how humans naturally evolved to work.\\nI\\u0026rsquo;m very much looking forward to ongoing evolution of the tablet. As processing power grows, what will they be capable of? Will we move beyond simply sliding images beneath panes of glass?\\nHow will tablets impact the future of interactive design (or web design, if you prefer)?\\n\",\"summary\":\"I never really got the appeal of an iPad.

Back in the day, if a visitor wanted to make the text on a website bigger, they increased the font size in their browser. Page zooming is now the accepted standard, and ems were creating some weird issues in the comments section, so this is a welcome change. My icons looked absolutely awful on the new iPad retina display, so I'm now using an icon font set powered by Pictos by IcoMoon. They look stunning at any size. I'm now using hand-coded share buttons instead of the ones Twitter and Facebook provide. In conjunction with the Pictos icons, they look crisp and consistent on any screen. I optimized for Instapaper. The app does a great job of pulling content from articles, but often grabs extra stuff too, like titles, share buttons and so on. Two little tags in HTML and my articles now pull flawlessly into the app. I'm a huge fan of Instapaper, and highly recommend it.

I was torn between two plans - the 250mb plan for $20 and the 2gb plan for $30.\\nThe sales rep at the Verizon Wireless store told me that if I chose the 2gb plan, I could watch her usage for a couple of months and lower her plan later if needed.

The Runaround\\nAfter watching my wife\\u0026rsquo;s usage for two months, we found she was consistently using less than 250mb. She does most of her browsing at home on our wifi network.\\nSo we headed to store to lower her plan, where we were told that, because the plan is no longer offered, there\\u0026rsquo;s nothing they can do.\\nI understand that promotional offers are common in this industry, and that they have a short shelf-life. But I was never told this was a promotional rate. If I had been, I would have started with the lower plan, knowing that I could always move up.\\nNow, I feel duped into a higher data plan than I need that I can\\u0026rsquo;t lower. Even though the rep told me I could lower it at any time.\\nJust use more data Frustrated, I did what any internet savvy lad would do and took to Twitter. I messaged @VZWSupport and explained my situation. Here\\u0026rsquo;s what they told me\\u0026hellip;\\nI would suggest that your wife increase her usage to get better value from the plan. That\\u0026rsquo;s right. Their solution wasn\\u0026rsquo;t to figure out how to make it right. It was that we use more data.\\nWilling to lose a customer That difference between the plan we wanted and the plan we have is $120 a year. That\\u0026rsquo;s not a lot of money, but it\\u0026rsquo;s not pocket change, either. We\\u0026rsquo;ve been customers of Verizon for 12 years. We give them a decent amount of money every year.\\nBut because of this situation, we\\u0026rsquo;re considering switching carriers. Instead of that extra $120, they\\u0026rsquo;ll get nothing. Seems like a bad business decision to me.\\nA few additional notes  At no point in the Twitter exchange did the reps from @VZWSupport ask for contact info so we could take the conversation to a more appropriate venue. Discussing a frustrating billing issue publicly on Twitter is both ineffective and bad marketing for Verizon. We used to have a family plan, but because work pays for my phone, we cancelled it when we upgraded my wife to the iPhone. Verizon continued to charge us for the cancelled family plan for two months, even after having a lengthy phone call with Customer Support about it.

While Xerox approached this is a refreshingly benevolent and transparent way, E. B. White feared that it would set a dangerous precedent that encroached on the spirit of the free press.\\nOne section in E. B. White\\u0026rsquo;s second letter stood out to me\\u0026hellip;\\nThe press in our free country is reliable and useful not because of its good character but because of its great diversity. As long as there are many owners, each pursuing his own brand of truth, we the people have the opportunity to arrive at the truth and to dwell in the light. The multiplicity of ownership is crucial. It's only when there are a few owners, or, as in a government-controlled press, one owner, that the truth becomes elusive and the light fails. For a citizen in our free society, it is an enormous privilege and a wonderful protection to have access to hundreds of periodicals, each peddling its own belief. There is safety in numbers: the papers expose each other's follies and peccadillos, correct each other's mistakes, and cancel out each other's biases. The reader is free to range around in the whole editorial bouillabaisse and explore it for the one clam that matters—the truth. As the ownership of major news outlets becomes increasingly concentrated (what FreePress.net refers to as the Big Six dominate the US media), White\\u0026rsquo;s insights strike me as more important now than ever. Diversity of Publications\\nOver the last decade, we\\u0026rsquo;ve seen the practice of blogging go from a fringe hobby to a massively mainstream endeavor. Some of the most respected news venues - particularly in the tech and political arenas - are not traditional print publications, but blogs. And while many blogs do not adhere to any rigorous journalistic standards, the best online publications do.\\nThis all reminds me of the very early days of the press. Many small publications, all sharing their own slightly different take on the news. As White points out, that diversity is critically important. While major publications have been slowly eroding that diversity, the internet is overwhelming giving it back.\\nWhich brings me to another important point\\u0026hellip;\\nAdvertising in the Press Whenever money changes hands, something goes along with it—an intangible something that varies with the circumstances. It would be hard to resist the suspicion that Esquire feels indebted to Xerox, that Mr. Salisbury feels indebted to both, and that the ownership, or sovereignty, of Esquire has been nibbled all around the edges... Not all corporations would approach subsidy in the immaculate way Xerox did or in the same spirit of benefaction. Advertising has a long history in the newspaper business. Paper is expensive. Printing is expensive. For many papers, advertising was a necessary evil to get important ideas and opinions out the people.\\nBecause of these dangers, reputable publications have very strict standards on how advertising is placed. If you\\u0026rsquo;re writing a car review, for example, it\\u0026rsquo;s considered bad form to place an ad for that car opposite the article.\\nDespite these safeguards, I believe advertising still has a negative effect on the press. For example, newspaper length is often determined not by how much news there is to share that day, but on how many ad spots there are and how much room is needed or left over.\\nAnd these adverse effects have now trickled onto the web.\\nAdvertising on the Web Advertising along the sides of articles is generally innocuous (though far too many bloggers place advertising ahead of user experience). Sponsored articles feel a bit more sinister. Where is the line between advertising and editorializing drawn? How might a reader identify it?\\nRecently I\\u0026rsquo;ve noticed a new kind of hybrid advertising model: the sponsored feed. Rather than a full article, sponsors get a short post noting that they\\u0026rsquo;re that week\\u0026rsquo;s sponsor, and a one or two paragraph blurb about who they are and what they do.\\nThe intent here is good, but there\\u0026rsquo;s an implication that the blogger supports and approves of the product. Maybe they do, in which case it\\u0026rsquo;s hard to begrudge them making a few dollars saying so. But what if they don\\u0026rsquo;t? Or what if they do, but then at some point the product no longer meets their expectations. Would they feel comfortable saying so?\\nThe Wrong Business Model Advertising exists in print because it\\u0026rsquo;s prohibitively expensive without it. That\\u0026rsquo;s not the case with blogs.\\nYou can get a self-hosted blog going for about $70 a year. If you\\u0026rsquo;re short on funds, you can let Wordpress host it through a custom domain for $15 a year. And if you\\u0026rsquo;re really cheap, a free Wordpress or Tumblr domain blog isn\\u0026rsquo;t the worst thing in the world.\\nThe other argument in favor of advertising is that the best writers won\\u0026rsquo;t do it if they\\u0026rsquo;re not fairly compensated. I agree. Good journalism is worth good money.\\nI don\\u0026rsquo;t believe advertising is the right model to pay for that journalism on the internet.\\nWhat will people pay for? So what\\u0026rsquo;s an online publication to do? The popular argument is that you can\\u0026rsquo;t charge for content on the internet - there are simple too many free alternatives.\\nI don\\u0026rsquo;t have any great answers, but one of the most compelling alternatives I\\u0026rsquo;ve seen comes from Oliver Reichenstein of Information Architects. Oliver suggests we create a \\u0026ldquo;business class\\u0026rdquo; for news, in which users pay for a superb reading experience.\\nQuote a publishing house executive, Oliver writes\\u0026hellip;\\nSo tell me: Why do people fly Business Class? In the end, an airplane brings me to the same place regardless of whether I fly Economy or Business Class... People pay for Business Class because they don’t want to be tortured in Economy. They get faster lanes at the terror check. They get an extra glass of champagne. The stewards are more attentive. They get off the plane more quickly. They get the feeling of a higher social status. What if we could do something similar with online publishing? (Oliver explores ways we might do that in more detail in his post.)\\nAnd maybe high-quality writing is something people will pay for. The New York Times seems to be doing alright despite their pay wall, though I\\u0026rsquo;m still not convinced that\\u0026rsquo;s the best business model.\\nLetters of Note, while not a news site, is publishing a book containing the best letters from the site. Site curator Shuan Usher was able to quickly secure funding from regular readers - not VCs or major publishers - and is moving forward with his project. While this model wouldn\\u0026rsquo;t work for most sites, it\\u0026rsquo;s yet another example of a creative alternative to advertising.\\n(Worth noting, Shuan does have one small ad on his site.)\\nBack to the Beginning The exchange between E.B. White and W. B. Jones is insightful, fiercely cordial and quite persuasive. In fact, because of White\\u0026rsquo;s letters, Xerox actually pulled out of the project. People just don\\u0026rsquo;t write like that anymore.\\nVisit Letters of Note and read the full exchange.

In 1873, the country had some four thousand breweries, working in dozens of regional and ethnic styles. Brooklyn alone had nearly fifty. Beer was not only refreshing but nutritious, it was said—a “valuable substitute for vegetables,” as a member of the United States Sanitary Commission put it during the Civil War. The lagers brewed by Adolphus Busch and Frederick Pabst were among the best. In 1878, Maureen Ogle notes in her recent book “Ambitious Brew: The Story of American Beer,” Busch’s St. Louis Lager took on more than a hundred European beers at a competition in Paris. The lager came home with the gold, causing an “immense sensation,” in the words of a reporter from the Times. Then came Prohibition, followed hard by industrialization. Beer went from barrel to bottle and from saloon to home refrigerator, and only the largest companies could afford to manufacture and distribute it. A generation raised on Coca-Cola had a hard time readjusting to beer’s bitterness, and brewers diluted their recipes accordingly. In 1953, Miller High Life was dismissed by one competitor as a beer for “women and beginners.” Within a decade, most other beers were just as flavorless. There\\u0026rsquo;s a ton of interesting nuggets in the article. One of my favorite beers is Blue Moon, and I was surprised to learn that they\\u0026rsquo;re not a small, craft brewery, as they\\u0026rsquo;d like you to believe, but rather a spinoff product by Coors designed to capitalize on the new market.\\nWhile wine as a beverage is older, beer has a long, long history. Sam Calgione and his brewers at Dogfish have actually brewed batches of beer based on recreated recipes dating back several thousands years BCE. And while wine fermentation is a natural process that\\u0026rsquo;s gently pushed along by vineyards, the creation of beer is an intense labor.\\nIt\\u0026rsquo;s a great read.

Reading blogs is my achilles heel. When I have books to read (typically fiction) the number is lower, but I'm between novels right now, so I'm reading blogs like mad to fill the void. I tend to not watch a lot of TV, so yay there!  Working Smarter  I admit, I'm easily distracted. Worst thing about working at a computer is that there's always something to distract you. I've started doing more of my work \\\"analog\\\" in a Muji notebook when I can. I check email every half-hour. It's almost never anything useful. That said, on days where I'm in the zone, I'll check it twice - once at the beginning of the day, and once at the end of the day. I can't always do this, but when I can, I like to pick one project and work on nothing but that all day. I get way more done this way. I found GTD far too complex. I now use a simple system: - My calendar tells me when I have meetings. - I keep one big to-do list... project headings, with sub-items for all the action steps beneath them. - On most days I use a Fieldnotes notebook for a daily to-do list of 3 - 5 things that need to happen that day. I also generally ignore my desk phone in the same way I ignore my email. I'll check voicemails periodically, and pick up my cell phone right away.  The Right Fuel  As you know, I've started exercising again. It's made a big difference. I have an egg-and-cheese sandwich almost every day. As a guilty pleasure, I usually have sausage on it too. Trying to cut that out and replace it with fruit. I don't drink much coffee, that I do require a daily cup in the morning. I wish I didn't need it. \",\"summary\":\"Last week, Adam Axon shared his tips on how he focuses and gets awesome stuff done.

The airline we booked our flights through clearly understands the value of a good user interface. They use a soft, soothing color palette, thoughtful typography, fun yet intuitive icons, and big, easy-to-click buttons. As you move deeper into the site, however, they start doing things that are confusing. For example, if you opt to look at flights only, after choosing your flights, they offer you the option to add a hotel. The big button says, \\u0026ldquo;Continue without Hotel.\\u0026rdquo;\\nThe next screen offers you the option to book a car. The big button says, \\u0026ldquo;Show me all Cars,\\u0026rdquo; with small text below it to continue without booking one. In keeping with the previous pattern, the big button should be the option to skip the car booking page.\\nBy creating a pattern and then breaking it, someone visiting the site can quite easily make a choice they didn\\u0026rsquo;t intend to. At best, this is bad user interface design. At worst, it\\u0026rsquo;s a deliberate attempt to mislead people who visit the site.\\nThe site also positions up-sell options in big, bold typography with strong calls to action, while things like redeeming discounts and credits are obscured by small font sizes amid a sea of other options.\\nOne of the more offensive aspects of the user interface, though, is this blatantly misleading piece of copy:\\nNew government regulations require us to HIDE taxes in your fares. This is not consumer-friendly or in your best interest. It's wrong and you shouldn't stand for it. Starting January 24, 2012, fares are distorted. This is a technically true statement, but here\\u0026rsquo;s the reality: This airline has a history of advertising exceptionally low fares, and then as you move deeper into the process, they add all sorts of taxes and fees. By the time you realize this, you\\u0026rsquo;re already pretty well invested.\\nIn reality, they\\u0026rsquo;re the ones hiding the fees by not publishing them until the end. It\\u0026rsquo;s dishonest.\\nI\\u0026rsquo;m sure these dark patterns benefit the airline in the short term. But ultimately, they erode brand trust.

PAWS is a fantastic dog rescue organization I\\u0026rsquo;ve had the pleasure of working with for the last two years, since my wife and I adopted our latest dog, Bailey.\\nI wanted to walk you through the process and decisions we made. Business Needs\\nPAWS pulls dogs from high-kill shelters - in some cases, euthanasia rates are higher than 85 percent, which means only one or two dogs come out for every ten that go in. They give them much needed TLC and veterinary care, and then place them in loving homes.\\nPAWS is staffed entirely by volunteers, and funded entirely by donations.\\nThey have three main priorities for their website:  Place dogs in adoptive homes. Get donations. Find volunteers. \\nA large portion of the donations PAWS receives come from repeat donors and people who have previously adopted from them. Being able to keep in touch with their fans is important.\\nThrough research, we also discovered that one of the key priorities for people visiting non-profit websites is a clear understanding of how the organization works. That said, a majority of the traffic coming to the PAWS website is from Petfinder, where people have already found a dog that they\\u0026rsquo;re interested in and are looking to fill out an adoption form.\\nThe Existing Site PAWS existing site was designed by me about a year and a half ago. It included integrated social sharing, friendly colors, and more upbeat messaging that their previous site. It was also built on Wordpress, allowing them to make updates in my absence.\\nThere were some clear challenges with the site though\\u0026hellip;\\nCalls-to-Action PAWS has three main priorities, but only one of them was represented on the home page. The main focus was on how they work, with a single call-to-action below it inviting people to adopt.\\nWeak Typography The dominant font on the existing site was Lucida Sans, a delightful font that plays well at smaller sizes but doesn\\u0026rsquo;t work well in larger form. That means that titles looked a bit odd, and the spacing between lines and characters was a bit too big in particular sections of the site.\\nStock Imagery The existing imagery on the site was stock photos of dogs. PAWS does amazing work, but it wasn\\u0026rsquo;t represented in the images on their landing page.\\nNot Mobile Friendly People are increasingly browsing the web from their phones, and the existing site was not easy to use on a mobile device. It may not actually have been a problem right now, but in a year or two, it most likely would be.\\nThe Redesign The redesign was more of a facelift than a complete overhaul. Here\\u0026rsquo;s what we did\\u0026hellip;\\nCalls-to-Action There are now three calls-to-action instead of one: Adopt, Donate, and Volunteer. These are directly aligned with their three most important priorities for people visiting the site.\\nI created simple icons to go along with each action, and they\\u0026rsquo;re repeated in the sidebar of every other page on the site. This creates repetition and consistency.\\nInvitations to Connect The home page features a clear invitation to keep in touch - by email, through the blog, or on Facebook. Like the calls-to-action, this is repeated in the sidebar of every other page on the site.\\nRemember, many of their donations come from former adopters and repeat donors. Inviting people to keep in touch is important to PAWS ongoing success.\\nHow We Work The overview of how PAWS works is still featured on the home page, but it\\u0026rsquo;s decreased in priority below the calls-to-action. There\\u0026rsquo;s also a link to learn more in the sidebar of each page.\\nDoing so keeps this key piece of information where people can easily see and find it, without hiding or de-prioritizing the calls-to-action.\\nBetter Typography The new site features the Museo font family. Headers are in Museo Slab, while the body is in Museo Sans. Because they\\u0026rsquo;re both from the same font family, they work very nicely together.\\nThe more pleasant a site is to read and navigate, the better you feel about the organization, and the more likely you are to do business with them.\\nNaturally, not everyone has these fonts on their computer, so they\\u0026rsquo;re embedded using the @font-face HTML5 tag. Older browsers that don\\u0026rsquo;t support this tag degrade gracefully to Helvetica or Arial and Georgia or Times.\\nReal PAWS Dogs Instead of stock photography, the site now features beautiful photos of real PAWS dogs. They were all taken by Jenn Frankavitz, a professional photographer and PAWS volunteer.\\nI was delighted that we were able to do this. It creates bragging rights for adopters (\\u0026ldquo;My dog is on the homepage!\\u0026rdquo;). That\\u0026rsquo;s a great word-of-mouth opportunity.\\nBut more importantly, the dogs PAWS rescues are the organization. They\\u0026rsquo;re the story. Why not let them tell it?\\nMobile Friendly Mobile browsing is growing rapidly. You may have heard that people looking at websites are only doing quick tasks, like looking up a phone number or getting directions. That\\u0026rsquo;s true\\u0026hellip; sometimes.\\nBut people are also browsing the web on their mobile devices for extended periods of time. Where before they may have opened up their laptop, people are now browsing on their phone or iPad. They\\u0026rsquo;re shopping. They\\u0026rsquo;re watching movies. And maybe they\\u0026rsquo;re looking for their next dog.\\nNow it\\u0026rsquo;s easier than ever for people to learn about PAWS New England on their mobile device.\\nThe site now detects the screen size it\\u0026rsquo;s being viewed on and adjusts itself accordingly. Tablets in portrait mode lose the sidebar to put the focus on the content. Mobile phones benefit from larger font sizes and a drop-down menu navigation that takes up less screen real estate.\\nLighter Code Amazingly, the new site actually has fewer lines of code. By being more thoughtful about how how elements are positioned and arranged on the page, I was able to cut out some redundancy and remove a healthy handful of the CSS.\\nCheck It Out If you haven\\u0026rsquo;t yet, head over to PAWSNewEngland.com and see the site in action. If you\\u0026rsquo;re using a modern, standards-compliant browser like Chrome, Firefox or Safari, try resizing the window to see how the website adjusts itself.\\nAnd maybe check out some of the wonderful dogs they have available for adoption.\\n\",\"summary\":\"Last week, I launched a website redesign for PAWS New England.

I stopped lifting weights shortly after college, and have tried several times to get back into it but end up quitting after a week or two.\\nIt\\u0026rsquo;s been about two months, and I already feel more energetic and look better.\\nBut finding the time, energy and commitment to go - especially when it\\u0026rsquo;s cold and dark out - is tough. Today, I want to share a few tips and tricks that have helped me get back in gear.\\n\\nNote: I\\u0026rsquo;m not a trainer. I have no credentials in this stuff. I\\u0026rsquo;m not even terribly strong. I have learned a bunch of stuff over the years from the really smart people at the JP Fitness Forum. Many of them are certified trainers, a few of them famously so. This is just my personal experience trying to get back into an exercise routine as a skinny (in an insulting way), busy, lazy guy.\\nMy Core Principles  Compound exercises (those that work multiple muscles) are better than isolation exercises (those that work just one). Good form is more important than heavy weight. Working out with intensity is more important than working out for long periods of time.  The Plan  Three or four compound movements per workout. Two or three workouts per week (every two or three days). A new group of exercises and set/rep scheme every three to six weeks (the human body adapts to change very quickly).  The Exercises Here\\u0026rsquo;s the menu of compound exercises I\\u0026rsquo;ll be selecting from as I plan my workouts.\\nQuad Dominant Squats Lunges\\nHip Dominant Deadlifts Good Mornings Hyperextensions Pull-Throughs\\nVertical Push Shoulder Press Dips\\nVertical Pull Pullups/Chinups High Pulls\\nHorizontal Push Bench Press (in all its varieties) Pushups\\nHorizontal Pull Bent and Cable Rows\\nMy Routine I find that A/B split routines, by virtue of their simplicity, are the easiest for me to stick with.\\nHere\\u0026rsquo;s how the work: I set up two different workout routines, and alternate between them (allowing a day in between for rest). So on Monday I\\u0026rsquo;ll do workout A, then on Wednesday I\\u0026rsquo;ll do workout B, and then on Saturday I\\u0026rsquo;ll do workout A again. On Monday of the following week, I pick back up with workout B and so on.\\nFor each workout, I pick one leg-based movement (quad or hip dominant), one push movement, and one pull movement, making sure I\\u0026rsquo;ve picked one from each category between both workouts.\\nFor example\\u0026hellip;\\nWorkout A Quad Dominant Horizontal Push Horizontal Pull\\nWorkout B Hip Dominant Vertical Pull Vertical Push\\nMy current workout looks like this\\u0026hellip;\\nWorkout A Barbell Squat Bench Press Bent-over Dumbbell Row\\nWorkout B Deadlift Chinups Dumbbell Shoulder Press\\nSets \\u0026 Reps The general guidelines around picking a set/rep scheme are as follows:  The fewer repetitions you do in each set, the more weight you can lift. If you care about strength, lift heavy amounts of weight. If you care about muscle growth, do more total repetitions (volume). \\nDepending on what you care about - growth, strength or both - you can pick your set/rep scheme accordingly. So if you want to be strong but small, do just a few reps with heavy weights, and only do a few sets of each exercise. If you care about growth, lift lighter weights for more repetitions. If you care about both, you can do many sets of just a few reps each, with heavy weights, which gives you more weight and more volume.\\nExamples Just strength: 3x3 (three sets of three repetitions, heavy weight) Just growth: 3x12 (three sets of twelve repetitions, light weight) Both: 8x3 (eight sets of three repetitions, heavy weight)\\nRight now I\\u0026rsquo;m doing three sets of eight repetitions for each exercise. That provides a nice balance of strength and growth with moderate weight, since I\\u0026rsquo;m just getting back into the swing of things.\\nOther Schemes Over the next several months, I\\u0026rsquo;ll be using the following set/rep schemes, in this order\\u0026hellip;\\n4x6 2x12 5x3 3x8\\nThe idea is that I\\u0026rsquo;ll continue to increase my weight while maintaining total volume (4x6), then back off and give my brain and body a few weeks of easier lifting (2x12). For the next six to eight weeks after that, I\\u0026rsquo;ll be focusing increasing my overall strength (5x3 and 3x8). No idea what I\\u0026rsquo;ll do after that.\\nWhat about... Abs? They\\u0026rsquo;re hit hard during squats, deadlifts, chinups, bent-over rows, and shoulder presses. Your abs are actually made up of several different muscle groups, and the \\u0026ldquo;sixpack\\u0026rdquo; muscles are the smallest and weakest ones there. Also, doing crunches won\\u0026rsquo;t remove fat from your stomach.\\nCurls? My biceps are already getting hammered during chinups and rows. If they\\u0026rsquo;re not exhausted when I\\u0026rsquo;m done with those, I\\u0026rsquo;m not using heavy enough weights.\\nCardio? By keeping my intensity up and limiting rest between sets, my heart is already beating pretty fast. Studies have shown that your heart rate stays elevated after an intense weight lifting session for much longer than after a traditional cardio workout. No cardio for me.\\nCustomizing this for your needs There are a few ways you could adapt what I\\u0026rsquo;m doing for your needs\\u0026hellip;\\n You could use a push/pull A/B split instead the total body version I'm doing. Workout A would be a quad-dominant movement, and both a vertical and horizontal push. Workout B would be a hip-dominant movement, and both a vertical and horizontal pull. You can adjust rest periods or do circuits. If you wanted to burn more fat, you could use really short rest periods between sets (say 30 seconds). You could also do a circuit, alternating between exercises with little or no rest, and then starting at the first exercise again (for example, squat, benchpress, row, repeat). You could add ab work at the ened... if you really want to. You could do cardio on your off days.  I can\\u0026rsquo;t stress enough how important using good form and picking appropriate weight for your experience level are. If you\\u0026rsquo;ve never worked out before, bring someone who has with you, or check out some of the tutorials on the JP Fitness Forum. Exercises like squats and deadlifts are safe if done properly, but if done wrong, you can really hurt yourself.\\nWhat I've Learned A few key takeaways\\u0026hellip;\\n If I have set days I'm supposed go (every Monday, for example), I'm more likely to workout. If I take off two days between each workout instead of just one, I have a better workout. My local Gold's Gym plays odd workout music. The other day I heard \\\"Backstreet's Back,\\\" \\\"I Saw the Sign,\\\" and \\\"Who Let the Dog's Out.\\\" Who's picking this stuff?!

It\\u0026rsquo;s the isolation.\\nCreativity requires interaction. It requires the collision of ideas in unexpected ways. It requires serendipity. Technology minimizes the isolation, but only to an extent. A webcam chat is great, but it\\u0026rsquo;s simply not the same as meeting face-to-face.\\nBut cubes aren't any better Cubicles suck. They\\u0026rsquo;re just as isolating as being home, but with the annoyance of random distractions like noisy neighbors and people who just drop by. They offer none of the collaborative advantages of a wall-free environment, but all of the downsides.\\nIf your options are work at home or work in a cube, you\\u0026rsquo;ve got a tough choice.\\nThe Bistro The headquarters building at EMC has what we call \\u0026ldquo;the Bistro.\\u0026rdquo; It\\u0026rsquo;s a little coffee shop run by the fine folks at Sodexo, with news playing on a flat screen TV, ample seating, and a cappuccino machine.\\nIt\\u0026rsquo;s also my favorite place to work.\\nIt\\u0026rsquo;s far more noisy than a cube, but the noise is ambient. It fills the background rather than standing out against it, so it\\u0026rsquo;s actually less distracting. Think about someone talking on the phone in a silent room. Now imagine them doing that in a crowded restaurant.\\nBut, the Bistro also allows for random interaction. You see someone you haven\\u0026rsquo;t seen in a while, start talking about work, and suddenly, you\\u0026rsquo;re brainstorming on a project together.\\nPixar and forced collisions In the Steve Jobs bio, there\\u0026rsquo;s a section spent talking about Steve\\u0026rsquo;s vision for the Pixar office he helped build.\\nThere was a deliberate effort made to ensure that random collisions - of both people and ideas - would happen on a regular basis. Steve felt that these collisions are what drove creativity. I think he\\u0026rsquo;s right.\\n(This is discussed briefly in this short behind-the-scenes look at Pixar studios.)\\nTeam Collaboration One of the big benefits of location-independent work for me has been that I can choose the environment that works best for my current needs and preferences. If I need a quiet environment to grind out a lot of work, I can work at home. If I need or want interaction as I\\u0026rsquo;m planning out new ideas, I head to the Bistro.\\nBut while this approach may increase cross-organizational collaboration, it actually makes team collaboration more difficult. I may only encounter the people in my direct work group in person once a week.\\nRandom collisions are great, but ad-hoc meetings with specific people becomes more complicated in this type of setup.\\nSo if I\\u0026rsquo;m working on a project, and I think, \\u0026ldquo;I\\u0026rsquo;d love to pick Dave\\u0026rsquo;s brain on this!\\u0026rdquo; I can\\u0026rsquo;t just ping Dave through our chat client and meet him at a table in the Bistro. He could be in another building. He could be at home. The days of popping into someone\\u0026rsquo;s cube (for better or worse) are largely gone.\\nIs technology the solution? I don\\u0026rsquo;t believe technology will ever replace face-to-face interaction, but I do hope that someday technology minimizes some of these challenges.\\nWill video chat move to 3D, and will that actually help anything? If you want to get really scifi about it, will holograms or avatars make remote collaboration feel more real?\\nUltimately, the shift to location-independent work is a wonderful thing. I\\u0026rsquo;m excited to see how it evolves.\\n\",\"summary\":\"The Economist ran an interesting piece last month on the rise of co-working\\u0026hellip;\\nNine hours of isolation or 30 minutes trapped by the office bore?

Despite the perception of a greater variety of foods in today\\u0026rsquo;s supermarket, nutritional diversity has actually decreased. It\\u0026rsquo;s shocking - upsetting really - how much pull agricultural lobbyists have in Washington. Small and local farmers really, genuinely care about their product. You\\u0026rsquo;d be surprised by how many organic brands are now owned by huge corporations. Stonyfield Yogurt is owned by Danon, Kashi is owned by Kelloggs, and Tom\\u0026rsquo;s of Maine is owned by Colgate. \\nOrganic as Big Business One subject that Food, Inc. touched on, but didn\\u0026rsquo;t dive as deeply as I would have liked into - is the transition of the organic industry from local to big business.\\nThe founder of Stonyfield was prominently featured in this movie. He discussed how his more hardcore liberal friends were bothered by his company\\u0026rsquo;s relationship with organizations like Walmart. His position was that a million dollar deal with Walmart, in which an organic product replaces a factory-farmed one, has a huge payoff with regards to ecological and nutritional impact, just as a matter of scale. That\\u0026rsquo;s true.\\nOne thing not meaningfully discussed, though: Is it possible to really fulfill the ideals of the organic movement at big business scale?\\nNonetheless, Food, Inc. is a fantastic documentary with lots of great (if you\\u0026rsquo;ll pardon the pun) food for thought.

Yes, people would have asked for a faster horse, but what is the need there? To travel longer distances quicker. The automobile was the solution to that need. Pain points.

On average, they wagered about 40% of their winnings on Daily Doubles, while men wagered about 60%. Second, women took smaller risks when playing against two men than they did against a woman and a man or against two women. Women wagered about 22% less in male-dominated settings than they did in female-dominated ones. Men’s wagers were not affected by the gender of their opponents. Third and perhaps most interesting, “Although women decrease their wagers when competing in a male-dominated environment, women do not differ from men in their performance in these games.” In other words, women took smaller risks — especially when competing against men — but did just as well as men in their total results. These findings remind me of the chapter on gender differences in Brain Rules, a great book by John Medina.\\nThe takeaway in his book was the same: Men and women behave differently. Men and women handle stress differently, process certain emotions differently, and remember details differently. And according to the (far from conclusive) Swedish study, they also approach risk differently.\\nThere\\u0026rsquo;s a clear business benefit to having both men and women in leadership positions. It creates a more holistic leadership team.\\n\",\"summary\":\"A few weeks ago, Dan Pink shared the results of a Swedish study that analyzed risk taking by gender on the game-show Jeopardy\\u0026hellip;\\nWomen played more conservatively than men regardless of their opponents. On average, they wagered about 40% of their winnings on Daily Doubles, while men wagered about 60%.

The researchers at CERN have discovered a particle moving faster than the speed of light. Via the New York Times\\u0026hellip;\\nOne of the very pillars of physics and Einstein's theory of relativity — that nothing can go faster than the speed of light — was rocked Thursday by new findings from one of the world's foremost laboratories. European researchers said they clocked an oddball type of subatomic particle called a neutrino going faster than the 186,282 miles per second that has long been considered the cosmic speed limit. So how much faster was it going? A mere 60 billionths of a second. The BBC has a great piece on how the experiments were carried out, and why researchers are being very skeptical with their results\\u0026hellip;\\nNeutrinos come in a number of types, and have recently been seen to switch spontaneously from one type to another. The team prepares a beam of just one type, muon neutrinos, sending them from Cern to an underground laboratory at Gran Sasso in Italy to see how many show up as a different type, tau neutrinos. In the course of doing the experiments, the researchers noticed that the particles showed up 60 billionths of a second sooner than light would over the same distance - a tiny fractional change, but a consistent one. The team measured the travel times of neutrino bunches some 15,000 times, and have reached a level of statistical significance that in scientific circles would count as a formal discovery. But the group understands that what are known as \\\"systematic errors\\\" could easily make an erroneous result look like a breaking of the ultimate speed limit, and that has motivated them to publish their measurements. There\\u0026rsquo;s also a lot of great discussion going on in the comments section on the BBC article. My favorite is this one\\u0026hellip;\\nThis is the thing I find so fascinating about science. As Tim Minchin put it, \\\"Science adjusts it's views based on what's observed\\\". This discovery could one day change our understanding of the universe and the way in which things work. Doesn't meant previous scientists were wrong; all science is build on the foundation of others work. That's not arrogance, it's a thirst for knowledge. Couldn\\u0026rsquo;t have said it better myself. I\\u0026rsquo;m excited to see how this all shakes out!\\n\",\"summary\":\"This is really cool!

Recent research into the Neanderthal genome provides some compelling evidence that we did. Who are Neanderthals?\\nNeanderthals were our closest cousins, living in Europe and Asia until about 30,000 years ago, when they went extinct. Neanderthals and humans both evolved from the same shared ancestor, Homo Erectus, a small hominid that migrated out of Africa about 2 million years ago.\\nCountrary to popular belief, Neanderthals were not stupid cavemen. They actually had larger brains than humans, though of a slightly different shape.\\nNeanderthals had tools, ceremonies and language. If you were sitting next to one in a subway, you\\u0026rsquo;d probably just think they were a funny looking human.\\nSo... did we mate? Most likely, yes. Despite the debate, many anthropologist believe that humans and neanderthals mated and maybe even had children.\\nThe bigger question is: Did they pass on any of their genes?\\nHybrid species are quite common in the wild. But, they\\u0026rsquo;re often sterile. Ligers (lion-tiger hybrids) and mules and hinnies (donkey-horse hybrids), for example, cannot reproduce.\\nMany anthropologists speculate that if neanderthals and humans mated, they would have had sterile offspring and therefore no neanderthal genes would have spread into the human gene pool.\\nRecent research into the Neanderthal genome may prove otherwise.\\nComparing Genomes Peter Parham, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford, compared the human genome to the Neanderthal genome.\\nHLAs comprise a group of about 200 genes that are a vital part of our immune system. Some of these genes, known as alleles, are variable due to natural mutations in our chromosomes that occur as we continue to evolve in ways that hopefully help us fight off new diseases. Parham found after studying HLAs in modern European and African people that early European humans developed alleles in their genes that were identical to the ones found in Neanderthals, which quite naturally leads to the conclusion that they got there via breeding. One allele in particular, HLA-C*0702, found in the Neanderthal, is quite common in modern European and Asian populations, but is absent in modern Africans. Source: Physorg.com That last sentence is incredibly important. Since humans and Neanderthals both evolved from Homo Erectus, any shared genes could easily be attributed to that common ancestry.\\nThe most commonly accepted theory of human evolution is that we came into existence about 250,000 years ago in Africa, and then around 100,000 years ago, we started migrating out (just like Homo Erectus did a few million years earlier).\\nSince Neanderthals were only located in Europe and Asia, the absence of these common genes in African populations indicates that they were picked up through mating and not shared ancestry.\\nConclusive? Hardly. But it\\u0026rsquo;s compelling nonetheless.\\nMore Reading If you find topics like this as fascinating as I do, here\\u0026rsquo;s some additional reading\\u0026hellip;\\n Physorg.com - Breeding with Neanderthals appears to have helped early humans fight disease National Geographic: Last of the Neanderthals Discovery: The Real Eve Origins of Modern Humans: Multiregional or Out-of-Africa Wikipedia: Neanderthal, Homo Erectus, and Recent African Origin  Image by Andrea Piscopo\\n\",\"summary\":\"Are your part Neanderthal?\\nOne of the more interesting debates in anthropology is whether or not humans mated with Neanderthals.

In most companies, the financial suits and run-of-the-mill managers would immediately conclude that all those stolen salt and pepper shakers cost the company a fortune. They don't bother to see how those two little plastic planes can spark a dinner-table conversation for years. And each time the subject comes up, they're turned over, checked out, and create smiles all around. Virgin Airlines becomes a regular part of the conversation. In fact if the idea is clever enough, someone might even write a column about them and publish it in Fast Company.

You wouldn't ask your friends, \\\"How should I act so that you'll like me better?\\\" Yet we do that in business all the time. We hold focus groups and do market research. We try to figure out how people want us to speak to them.\\nInstead, organization\\u0026rsquo;s should say and do the things they actually believe, and they\\u0026rsquo;ll attract people who believe what they believe.\\nMy personal spinoff on this: Great marketing starts with a great product. If you have a great product, your job then becomes connecting with people who would love it rather than convincing people they want it.\\n4. Your product can be a badge of honor. If your company is clear about what it believes, your product can become a symbol of those beliefs for people who use them.\\nFor example, people who own Apple computers love to show them off and talk about them. It\\u0026rsquo;s not just a computer. It\\u0026rsquo;s a symbol of who you are and what you believe.\\n5. Generosity is undervalued and underutilized. Employees only interact with each other when they need something. Businesses only interact with customers when they want a sale.\\nWhat if we all started being more generous?\\nGenerosity is enjoyable by design. It benefits us as a species when we do it. Being generous allows you to build trust and loyalty among your peers and customers.\\n6.

First developed around 1453, the new technology invented by Gutenberg had moved beyond the experimental phase by 1480 and spread to some two dozen major urban centers, with many other short-lived presses in operation. Contemporaries at first raved about the great speed with which books could be printed, and also about the drop in price — by 80 percent on one contemporary’s estimate in 1468. But around 1500, humanist scholars began to bemoan new problems: Printers in search of profit, they complained, rushed to print manuscripts without attention to the quality of the text, and the sheer mass of new books was distracting readers from the focus on the ancient authors most worthy of attention. Printers “fill the world with pamphlets and books that are foolish, ignorant, malignant, libelous, mad, impious and subversive; and such is the flood that even things that might have done some good lose all their goodness,” wrote Erasmus in the early 16th century, in the kind of tirade that might seem familiar to anyone exhausted by what they find online today.

These are the bones left after the best meat has been taken. - Aaron Huey  Unemployment hovers between 85% and 95%. 38% of homes have no electricity. 60% are infested with black mold. 90% of the population lives below the federal poverty line. Tuberculosis is eight times higher than the national average. The infant mortality rate is the highest on the continent, and three times higher than the national average. The school drop-out rate is 70%, and teacher turnover is eight times the national average. Life expectancy for men is 46 to 48 years.  Some Questions There\\u0026rsquo;s no question that our nation\\u0026rsquo;s history with Native Americans has helped lead to their current situation. The indigenous people of Australia and the Inuit of the Arctic North deal with similar struggles born of a similar history.\\nThat said, Native Americans were not always the teepee living, peace-pipe smoking stereotype that gets attributed to them. Tribes went to war with each other well before British colonists showed up. They fought and died and suffered.\\nI also understand that poverty is vicious cycle that\\u0026rsquo;s insanely difficult to break. But people have done it. How much of the Lakota\\u0026rsquo;s current plight is caused by the Lakota themselves?\\nHow much of the Lakota\\u0026rsquo;s history do we, the descendants of colonial Americans, own? After all, it\\u0026rsquo;s a history that you and I were not part of. How much of this do the Lakota themselves own?\\nHow do we help? Can we help? Better yet, can we help the Lakota help themselves?\\nOpportunities, Not Handouts My buddy Ben Eubanks shared a great article by Dan Miller with me a few weeks ago titled, Opportunities, Not Handouts.\\nSeveral years ago Joanne and I were walking down the sidewalk to a restaurant in Atlanta, GA. A street vendor approached us with a newspaper “for sale.” I gave him $2.00 and we continued down the sidewalk. I laughed when in the next block we saw a dispensing box with the same paper – free for the taking. But I admired the salesman for creating a little business nonetheless. Now in Nashville there is a similar legitimate program. Homeless people are given 15 copies of The Contributor at no charge. They can sell those for $1.00 each and then return to buy more copies at $.25 each. They are trained how to sell these for $1.00 and agree to not be under the influence of drugs or alcohol while selling. I would love to say that the solution is to restore the Lakota to their traditional way of living. But traditions change. Even without colonization, I believe the Lakota would not look the same today as they did 200 years ago.\\nRather than looking back at the past with longing and envy, perhaps it\\u0026rsquo;s time to look to the future with hope and vision.\\nPerhaps what the Lakota need are opportunities, and a few strong role models of their own to seize them.\\nWhat do you think?\\n\",\"summary\":\"This is an article about the Lakota Tribe.

Independent artists give tons of stuff away online. Their songs are free, and if they\\u0026rsquo;re good, they spread really fast. No cost means no friction to slow them down. More listens equals more fans equals more people who pay to see you perform live and buy t-shirts and stickers at concerts.

Some chefs who spent their culinary careers in restaurants cite dissatisfaction with the impersonality of cooking in corporate kitchens. They say they'd rather know and interact with the people who eat their food. Other organizers love the artistic quality of staging a meal in unconventional settings. The restaurants usually begin with the chef inviting friends and cooking school classmates or restaurant colleagues to his or her house for a gourmet dinner. The food is excellent, as the chef usually has a traditional culinary education and sometimes years of restaurant experience. Typically the guests are so impressed that they tell their friends, and invite them to come along to the next dinner.

Location-based apps may be part of that shift\\u0026hellip; but only part of it.\\nThe REAL Future of Marketing I think the future of marketing is going to be defined by a three-step process:  Provide the customer with an awesome experience. Make it easy for them to interact with (and be delighted by) you again. Make it easy for them to tell their friends about it. \\nLet\\u0026rsquo;s explore these in more detail\\u0026hellip; 1. Awesome Experience\\nBetween globalization, the internet, and the mobile web, competing on price is a losing battle. The real way to stand out is to provide a better experience.\\nThat may mean more knowledge and courteous staff. It may mean a product that\\u0026rsquo;s better designed and easier to use. It may mean little extra details that exceed a customer\\u0026rsquo;s expectation. Whatever it is, you need to be better. Average isn\\u0026rsquo;t cutting it.\\nThis is the foundation of marketing.\\nIt\\u0026rsquo;s not an ad campaign. It\\u0026rsquo;s not getting the right info into the right hands at the right time (it\\u0026rsquo;s those things too, but they come later). It\\u0026rsquo;s being awesome first.\\n2. Keep Interacting Most permission-based marketing right now is very one-sided.\\nCan I have your email address? We'll send you coupons! The problem is, many marketers don\\u0026rsquo;t just send coupons. They send obnoxious volumes of sales copy. They violate consumer trust and sell email addresses to third parties.\\nSo you ask, and I say no. Opportunity lost.\\nWhat if instead you just gave someone a coupon? No email needed.

The takeaway: Innovation is more likely to happen when ideas collide, mix and reproduce.\\n \\nWhen you\\u0026rsquo;re focused on fewer things at once, there\\u0026rsquo;s less stuff bouncing around and colliding, and less new ideas coming out as a result. Pushing out lots of great ideas, often simultaneously, can actually lead to better stuff in the long-run.\\nAs Pablo Picasso once said, \\u0026ldquo;Inspiration exists, but it has to find you working.\\u0026rdquo;\\nNot Multitasking Just to be clear, I\\u0026rsquo;m not advocating multitasking.

That\\u0026rsquo;s a great thing!\\nThe Importance of Downtime All that said, I still believe that at some point, you need the time to focus singularly on a project and crank it out.\\nYou need downtime to think and process and plan. And then you need to take action.\\nFor me, 2011 will continue to be an exercise in portfolio reduction. The one thing I\\u0026rsquo;m probably worst at is getting rid of products that just don\\u0026rsquo;t work anymore. When you spend time creating something and it has some great initial success, it\\u0026rsquo;s tough to know (or admit) when it\\u0026rsquo;s just not relevant or working anymore.\\nThe \\u0026ldquo;do less, do better\\u0026rdquo; will continue, but more as a philosophy around product portfolio curation.

Not that bad\\u0026hellip;\\nThe company missed out on its goal of returning all water used in manufacturing processes to the environment at a level that supports aquatic life by the end of 2010. What happened? Admittedly, Coca-Cola did come close to reaching its goal. The company estimates that 94% of system facilities were compliant with wastewater treatment standards by the end of last year. But unexpected challenges prevented the company from fulfilling its standards completely.  Given how much water the soda-making process is, I actually think Coca-Cola should be commended for hitting 94% this year. Much of the missing 6% occurred in countries where systems and processes for treating industrial waste just aren\\u0026rsquo;t there yet.\\nThe bigger question, I think, is whether or not soda can ever truly be sustainable.\\nAccording to Houston Chronicle writer Eric Berger, soda takes 2,200 times more energy to produce than it creates in nutritional value. Plastic bottles have become the preferred packaging, and because of that, we now have giant islands of plastic floating around in the world\\u0026rsquo;s oceans.\\n \\nPlastic bottles also leach far more carbonation than cans and glass bottles do, so they over-carbonate them. The sugar and caffeine in soda aren\\u0026rsquo;t necessarily the worst things for you. The carbonation may be. It\\u0026rsquo;s created by forcing carbon dioxide particles into the mixture. It can exacerbate osteoporosis and decreases the amount of oxygen in your bloodstream for several hours after consumption.\\nI love soda. My dad worked at Pepsi for many years, and I have a can of Pepsi at lunch several times a week.\\nWhat I\\u0026rsquo;d love to see is the return of glass bottles. When I was in third grade, my family lived in Toronto, Canada, for a year. At the time, they had a very active bottle return program. The soda tasted a lot better because it was less carbonated and glass provided a better seal. The bottle was also rinsed and reused.\\nHow do we get glass bottles back on the shelf?\\n\",\"summary\":\"Image by FUNKYAH\\nAccording to Fast Company magazine, Coca-Cola fell short on one of it\\u0026rsquo;s 2010 sustainability goals.\\nHow bad was it?

His story was run in the school paper. My senior year in college, I rewrote the story, and have decided to rerun it here.\\nHe was dressed in faded black sweat-pants and an old, worn-out jacket. Greasy side burns and facial hair complimented the matted strands of gray hair peeking out the back of his snowcap.\\nHe held up a cardboard sign that read: \\u0026ldquo;HOMELESS: Please Help. Will Work. Thank you + GOD BLESS,\\u0026rdquo; and featured a large smiley face.\\nThis is how I met Pops, in January of 2001, in front of a shopping plaza on Oaklawn Avenue in Cranston.\\n\\u0026ldquo;Did you eat yet? Let\\u0026rsquo;s go grab some food,\\u0026rdquo; I offered, but he\\u0026rsquo;d already eaten. I slipped him a five, and asked him if I could talk to him for a bit.\\nFor the next hour he told me his story. Every time I pass a homeless person on the street, I wonder how they ended up there. Did life deal them a bad hand, or did they make some really bad choices in life? Maybe it was a combination of both, or perhaps they made some normal, human mistakes, and ended up paying for them just a little more than most people do.\\nPops, who offered me no other name, was giving me a chance to view his world from the inside out.\\nWhen I met him, Pops had been living on the streets for about three years. \\u0026ldquo;I haven\\u0026rsquo;t been homeless that long,\\u0026rdquo; he explained. He said he had a degree in civil engineering from Wentworth Institute of Technology, as well as some credits in computer science from the University of New Mexico. He was once a self-employed leather carver, and owned a shop that bore his name.\\nPops attributed his financial downfall to his divorce. \\u0026ldquo;She wiped me out,\\u0026rdquo; he stated coldly. After his divorce, he told me, he lost his motivation to work and succeed. \\u0026ldquo;I just took off and said, \\u0026lsquo;Ah, the hell with it! It\\u0026rsquo;s not worth it.\\u0026rsquo;\\u0026rdquo; He found himself living in a tent with a sleeping bag, carrying his few possessions with him: what little money he had, his cardboard sign, an old pair of leather gloves and a few loose pieces of paper.\\nHe explained to me that while he eventually regained his motivation, another obstacle stood in his way: a series of physical ailments he suffered as a result of his service in the Vietnam War. \\u0026ldquo;I flew medical helicopters, and I was shot down three times,\\u0026rdquo; he told me. Pops claimed to suffer from back problems caused by eight fractured vertebral discs, and was scheduled to go in for his sixth heart surgery.\\nHe told me that the arteries in his heart kept collapsing, and that his vision was impaired due to holes in his retina. He was on a changing regime of medications, and sometimes suffered seizures as a result. Due to the seizures, Pops biggest fear was collapsing and breaking his glasses. The aid he received would only pay to replace them once every two years, so broken glasses would have to be fixed out of pocket with money he didn\\u0026rsquo;t have.\\nPops\\u0026rsquo; struggle to find work was further compounded by his age and lack of a permanent address or phone number.\\nHe explained, \\u0026ldquo;I\\u0026rsquo;m over 55, I don\\u0026rsquo;t have a phone, and I don\\u0026rsquo;t have transportation.\\u0026rdquo; He had tried staying in shelters, but eventually chose not to because he found theft to be a constant problem. \\u0026ldquo;You can\\u0026rsquo;t go in the shower and take all your belongings,\\u0026rdquo; he told me, \\u0026ldquo;So when you come out, everything is missing.\\u0026rdquo; He added that because a shelter is not a permanent home, it couldn\\u0026rsquo;t be listed as an address when applying for jobs.\\nThese obstacles didn\\u0026rsquo;t stop Pops from trying. He told me that he frequently stood at the light in front of the plaza looking for work. \\u0026ldquo;I do pick up a lot of jobs here,\\u0026rdquo; he said. At the time, he was on a waiting list for low-income housing and was in the process of applying for social security.\\nWhen we see homeless people, we\\u0026rsquo;re often quick to draw conclusions about them. Pops both embodied and defied normal stereotypes about homeless people begging on the streets. He was quick to point out that he wasn\\u0026rsquo;t asking for money. He was asking for work, something he had a hard time finding. At the same time, his condition was his own doing, and he accepted that for the cold reality that it was.\\n\\u0026ldquo;This hole… you can\\u0026rsquo;t dig yourself out of this hole. It\\u0026rsquo;s almost impossible, and I accept that,\\u0026rdquo; Pops conceded. \\u0026ldquo;If God can give me just one more day, something good may happen. You never know.\\u0026rdquo;\\nThe one thing that struck me throughout my entire conversation with Pops was the beaming enthusiasm he put forth as he stared the bleak and harsh reality of his condition in the face.\\nI asked Pop if he\\u0026rsquo;d learned anything in his three long years living on the streets. He responded, \\u0026ldquo;There\\u0026rsquo;s a lot of good people out there, and there\\u0026rsquo;s a lot of bad people out there. I think the good outweigh the bad.\\u0026rdquo; He told me that these good people have helped him in his ongoing struggle to survive. \\u0026ldquo;I\\u0026rsquo;m gonna survive. A lot of people but don\\u0026rsquo;t, but I\\u0026rsquo;m gonna survive.\\u0026rdquo;\\nI told Pops I wanted to write a story about him for my high school newspaper, and he gave me his permission. I ran into a CVS to buy a disposable camera to take Pops\\u0026rsquo; photo, and he excused himself and darted behind an old bingo hall to relieve himself.\\nWhen I returned, he posed smiling, and added, \\u0026ldquo;Make sure you get the sign. I want people to see the smiley face.\\u0026rdquo; I promised him that when the article went to print, I\\u0026rsquo;d keep a few spare copies in my trunk to give to him if I ever saw him again.\\nIt\\u0026rsquo;s been four years since I met Pops, on a corner five minutes from my house. I never saw him again, but I\\u0026rsquo;ll never forget him. Until I bought a new car last year, I never took those spare copies out of the trunk of my car, either. And just as vividly as the day I met him, I remember Pops walking away down the street.\\nAs he headed towards West Warwick, he turned around and shouted back at me, \\u0026ldquo;Don\\u0026rsquo;t give up!\\u0026rdquo;\\nAfterthoughts: I\\u0026rsquo;m pretty passionate about homeless and hunger issues. I am a believer in personal responsibility and self-reliance, but I\\u0026rsquo;m also a believer in lending a hand whenever you can, particularly when people are most in need.\\nWe all make bad decisions at some point in our life, and I can\\u0026rsquo;t help but think that some of us end up paying for them more than others. Homelessness is, I imagine, a dark, difficult hole to climb out of.
