	<h1><span class="title">When what the client wants isn&amp;#8217;t what they need</span></h1>
	

	<p>On a recent client project, I had to tell a client that I wouldn&rsquo;t do what their CEO wanted. Or, more accurately, that I wouldn&rsquo;t do something <em>just</em> because their CEO wanted it.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="i-m-hired-to-solve-problems">I&rsquo;m hired to solve problems</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t hire you to create something they like, &amp; something they like may not solve their business problems.&rdquo;
- <a href="https://twitter.com/monteiro">Mike Monteiro</a> via <a href="https://twitter.com/danielmall/status/553687063866769408">Dan Mall</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my case, the client&rsquo;s CEO, &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t like white backgrounds on websites.&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s a valid matter of taste.</p>

<p>His preference, though, was a gradient black to charcoal background with light gray text and deep red links on it. For sighted users, it&rsquo;s difficult to read. For about 5-percent of the male population, those suffering from a few forms of colorblindness, it&rsquo;s completely unusable.</p>

<p>I explained my concerns. And I was told, &ldquo;This is the kind of thing you don&rsquo;t ask questions about. You just do it and move on.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-respond-to-that">How do you respond to that?</h2>

<p>The problem is, you don&rsquo;t hire me to cater to your tastes. My job as a web professional is to make my clients successful, and sometimes that means pushing back on bad decisions.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I did.</p>

<h3 id="1-have-the-tough-conversation">1. Have the tough conversation</h3>

<p>It was pretty obvious to me that my client wasn&rsquo;t comfortable pushing back on the CEO. So I offered to do it.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have to work there every day, and I understand the implications of the proposed solution. I can have a conversation that someone well below the CEO on the reporting structure might not feel comfortable having.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s more, the CEO may not &ldquo;like white backgrounds,&rdquo; but that doesn&rsquo;t automatically mean you need to use the existing gray on black. There are plenty of other combinations that fit in the brand color palette, are accessible, and attractive.</p>

<p>This suggestion was immediately dismissed.</p>

<h3 id="2-appeal-to-data">2. Appeal to data</h3>

<p>Given the desire to please the CEO, I thought data might be a more effective approach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you know that with the proposed solution, about 5-percent of the male visitors to your site won&rsquo;t be able to use it effectively?&rdquo; Surely the CEO would want to maximize visitors who can use a site, no?</p>

<p>Maybe, but my contact at the client site still didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable moving forward, data or not.</p>

<h3 id="3-the-legal-implications">3. The legal implications</h3>

<p>At this point, you may be thinking, &ldquo;Why not just do what the client wants and move on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Because clients don&rsquo;t hire me because I make them happy. I mean, I do that, too. But my job is make them successful. That&rsquo;s how I make them happy. And this was a decision that would be detrimental to their success.</p>

<p>My last attempt: appeal to the legal implications. I sent them the <a href="http://www.ada.gov/anprm2010/web%20anprm_2010.htm">American&rsquo;s With Disabilities Act specifications on Web Accessibility</a>, and specifically called out the section on color contrast and vision impairment.</p>

<p>I mentioned that going forward with their proposed solution might put them at risk of violating the Act, and offered an alternate solution. Use almost-black text on a light-gray background. It&rsquo;s not white, and it&rsquo;s a pattern that was already in use on their existing site.</p>

<p>That did the trick.</p>

<h2 id="getting-the-confidence-to-tell-a-client-no">Getting the confidence to tell a client &ldquo;no&rdquo;</h2>

<p>Until recently, I didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable telling clients &ldquo;no.&rdquo; I believed my job was to do what they asked me to do.</p>

<p>Then I discovered <a href="https://twitter.com/monteiro">Mike Monteiro</a>.</p>

<p>First, his talk, <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVkLVRt6c1U">F*ck You, Pay Me</a>*, which influenced how I set up my freelance business. Then, his book, *<a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/design-is-a-job">Design is a Job</a></em>, which is required reading for anyone in a creative field who interacts with clients. Then I saw him talk at <a href="http://aneventapart.com/event/boston-2013">An Event Apart Boston</a> about how the things our clients don&rsquo;t know about design are our fault, not theirs.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/jVkLVRt6c1U?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Mike has done more to influence my thinking around the business of web work than anyone. He also helped me have the confidence to stand up for what I think is right instead of just doing what the client wants.</p>

<p>Check out his work.</p>
