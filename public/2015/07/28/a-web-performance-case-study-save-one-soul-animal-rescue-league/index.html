	<h1><span class="title">A web performance case study: Save One Soul Animal Rescue League</span></h1>
	

	<p>Earlier this year, I provided <a href="http://sosarl.org/">Save One Soul Animal Rescue League</a> with some guidance on how to improve the performance of their website.</p>

<p>At the time, their site was taking <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/result/141013_H6_QWE/">3.5 seconds to start rendering</a>, and it was more than 7 seconds before the first piece of visible text even showed up. After implementing my recommendations, <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/result/150426_W6_NBP/">their site starts rendering content in 1.7 seconds</a>, with text becoming readable in under 3 seconds.</p>

<p>Their site is more than twice as fast as it was before!</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s still a lot of little things they can do to improve those numbers even further, but a few minor changes had a big impact on their site.</p>

<p>I interviewed Mike Gualtieri, the web developer for SOSARL, to talk about the changes he made and how they affected the sites performance. Here&rsquo;s what he had to say.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="the-interview-with-sosarl">The Interview with SOSARL</h2>

<p><strong>Chris (from Go Make Things): What made you decide to focus on web performance for SOSARL?</strong></p>

<p>Mike (from SOSARL): I had e-mailed you in October of 2014 to thank you, as your design for PAWS New England had very much inspired the design of SOSARL&rsquo;s site.</p>

<p>The problem with my design was that sure, I had designed it to look all slick but it had absolutely no optimization&mdash;a point you raised to me in our e-mail exchange. I knew that the site seemed to load a little slow sometimes, but I hadn&rsquo;t done a test in quite some time.</p>

<p>Seeing the load times that you had gotten when you analyzed the site was eye-opening and a reminder that I though I had built a good-looking site, it won&rsquo;t mean a thing if users are giving up when the page isn&rsquo;t loading fast enough. So, I took some of the great advice that you had given me and I was able to cut down the load time in half, and then some.</p>

<p><strong>Chris: Where there any key metrics or targets you looked at? Did you have a target goal for the finished optimizations?</strong></p>

<p>Mike: I didn&rsquo;t have a specific target in mind, I just knew that I needed to bring the &ldquo;Time to First Byte&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Start Render&rdquo; time way down. Originally they were 2.330s and 3.562s, respectively - contributing to a total load time of 18.684s.</p>

<p>When I saw that number, I couldn&rsquo;t believe it, my jaw almost went through the floor. Imagine waiting almost 20 seconds for a site that you want to visit to fully render&mdash;it was completely unacceptable.</p>

<p><strong>Chris: What steps did you take to the improve your site performance?</strong></p>

<p>Mike: First I went for the easy stuff. I got rid of a few parallax effects and slide/fade-in animations that I had given to some images. They were &ldquo;nice-to-have,&rdquo; but honestly completely unnecessary as far as the average user for our site goes.</p>

<p>I also identified several images that were taking <em>way</em> too long to load because they were ridiculously large and uncompressed&mdash;something I had been a bit careless about. I scaled and compressed the images that needed it, and in some cases completely ditched the original image and went with something else altogether.</p>

<p>After that, I saw that there was a JS-based widget that we were loading in the footer which showed a random adoptable dog&rsquo;s name/picture as a &ldquo;Featured Dog&rdquo;. This was taking almost 12 seconds to load! I decided to get rid of that widget on all pages site-wide. It was not used much at all, and it was all the way down in the footer area, which is unlikely to be seen by the casual user.</p>

<p>Those were the heaviest hitters by themselves, but I still decided there was more to be done, so I installed <a href="http://zencache.com/">Quick Cache (now ZenCache)</a> since we&rsquo;re on the <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress platform</a>. I enabled server-side <em>and</em> client-side caching, which made a <em>huge</em> difference&mdash;almost an unbelievable amount of difference in load times.</p>

<p>After installing ZenCache Pro (we sprung for the Pro option, more on that soon), I saw that it detected we weren&rsquo;t leveraging <a href="http://gzipwtf.com/">gZIP compression</a>, so I modified our <code>.htaccess</code> file and voila! I was seeing an 80% reduction in file size.</p>

<p>ZenCache Pro also minifies HTML/CSS for me, so I enabled that and saw even faster load times.</p>

<p>Finally, I researched some ways to defer the loading of javascript or load it asynchronously, since a ton of it was done in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section. I installed a plugin to handle that, and once I did that my load time decreased by at least another 20%.</p>

<p><strong>Chris: Of the changes you made, what had the biggest impact on your performance?</strong></p>

<p>Mike: Installing ZenCache Pro, by far. The combination of the minifying/combining of the CSS files, as well as the client/server-side caching was <em>huge</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Chris: Which of your optimizations was the hardest to implement?</strong></p>

<p>Mike: So, confession time: I&rsquo;m not a web designer/developer by trade, I&rsquo;m an IT guy&mdash;a virtualization engineer to be specific. When it comes to building websites, I know my way around for sure, and I know what the average user is looking for, but I&rsquo;m relatively novice as far as coding goes. I&rsquo;m learning for sure, this whole experience has taught me so much, but I&rsquo;m by no means an expert.</p>

<p>With that out of the way&hellip; we&rsquo;re using a Wordpress.org platform for sosarl.org, so I simply installed ZenCache Pro and WP Deferred Javascripts, made the appropriate tweaks and made sure I didn&rsquo;t break the website or the javascript-based toolkit which loaded our list of adoptable dogs.</p>

<p>There were other parts which were trial-and-error, but I&rsquo;d hardly say that was difficult to implement. I suppose if we replaced the word &ldquo;hardest&rdquo; with &ldquo;most time-consuming,&rdquo; it would be getting the images to be optimized while maintaining a high level of quality. That was a lot of time for me as I ended up ditching a whole bunch of images that didn&rsquo;t look great, so I ended up having to create all new images using GIMP. For instance, for some of the homepage sliders, there would be a large background image and a smaller foreground image on the slide. To create a nice effect, I&rsquo;d adjust the color saturation and darken the background image, and apply a slight-to-moderate blurring filter. The foreground image would be the original, unaltered image.</p>

<p>Eventually I ditched the slider foreground image and just went with a large, high-quality (but properly compressed) slider background image with a darkened box behind the slider text, and this saved not only load time, but the overall size of the page.</p>

<p>All told, I brought the site&rsquo;s size down from a whopping, hefty 9 MB to 1.9 MB. Still a bit high, but that&rsquo;s more than 4-fold improvement!</p>

<p>I should also mention that I&rsquo;m using a DB optimizer too (the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-optimize/">WP-Optimize plugin</a>) which runs automatically every week to keep our database size in check. What effect that has on performance, I&rsquo;m not sure&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t let the database get large enough for me to find out! But, with all of the page revisions, spam comments/trackbacks, the occasional orphaned post draft, I can see it getting out of control pretty easily, so at the very least, it can&rsquo;t hurt!</p>

<p><strong>Chris: I know you just made these changes a short while ago, but have you seen any changes your analytics yet as a result?</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, I wasn&rsquo;t doing a very good job of keeping metrics before January of this year, but I will say that since I put these optimizations in place around the March/April timeframe, we saw a huge uptick in visitors and page views.</p>

<p>Granted, that does coincide with more events being held in March/April (the epic amount of snow that was dumped on us really put a damper on events and adoptions at the beginning of the year), but it was a sizable (nearly 4-fold) increase.</p>

<p>Thank you again Chris for all the help and advice. It&rsquo;s been extremely valuable to me not only with SOSARL but a great learning experience that I can hopefully pass on to others too.</p>
