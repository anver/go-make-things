	<h1><span class="title">Typography First Web Design</span></h1>
	

	<p>Last week, I launched a redesign of Go Make Things with a single objective: to create a design that was really enjoyable to read.</p>

<p>Today, I want to walk you through the process, the decisions I made, and why I made them.

<h2>The Why</h2></p>

<p>In a word, <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a>.</p>

<p>Once you get used to reading articles in Instapaper, you gain a much deeper appreciation for good typography - large font sizes, well spaced and measured lines, and beautiful typefaces. And you start to realize how much reading on a typical webpage actually sucks.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to think Go Make Things was actually a pretty good reading experience already, but typography was not something I&rsquo;d spent much time thinking about.</p>

<p>For this experiment, I wanted to start with typography first, and build a web experience around that.</p>

<h2>The How</h2>

<p>As far as typefaces go, Georgia holds a special place in my heart.</p>

<p>Even when Instapaper released their recent update with a variety of new and beautiful fonts, I stuck with Georgia. It&rsquo;s the font I use in iBooks and my mobile RSS reader, too. It&rsquo;s incredible readable, even at smaller sizes.</p>

<p>So when I went to choose a primary typeface, Georgia was my first choice.</p>

<h3>Setting the Size</h3>

<p>I spent a few weeks experimenting with Georgia in various font sizes on my laptop, my iPhone and my iPad.</p>

<p>I wanted to a size that would be highly readable on both a standard resolution computer screen and high resolution Retina displays. A 16 pixel font size looks normal on a computer but too small on a Retina display. At 18 pixels, Georgia is beautiful on Retina but too big for the desktop.</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;m not wild about odd numbers, 17 pixels turned out to be just right for both.</p>

<h3>Setting the Width & Line Height</h3>

<p>After experimenting with a variety of line-lengths, somewhere around 85 characters-per-line turned out to be the most comfortable for long-form reading. That works out to 640 pixels wide for a 17 pixel font size.</p>

<p>I used Chris Pearson&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.pearsonified.com/typography/">Golden Ratio Typography calculator</a> to determine my line height, which came out to 26 pixels.</p>

<p>(<em>Chris&rsquo;s calculator is a great tool - I&rsquo;ll definitely be using this on all of my projects going forward!</em>)</p>

<h3>Creating a Typographic Scale</h3>

<p>In the past, I&rsquo;ve always just arbitrarily picked sizes for my headers and meta information, experimenting until I found something that &ldquo;looked right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, typographers have literally spent hundreds of years perfecting the art of the typographic scale. This time, I wanted to use their methods to great a more visually pleasing scale.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Ian Lamb&rsquo;s <a href="http://lamb.cc/typograph/">Typograph app</a> did all the heavy lifting. You enter your font size and line height, and select your desired scale (in this case, Traditional). The app provides you with a scale in pixels, ems and points.</p>

<p>This scale became the basis for every header, margin, list, and piece of text on the site. The one exception: headers are set with a line-height of 1.2 ems.</p>

<h2>Adding the Details</h2>

<p>At this point, I had a layout that was very readable but not terribly distinctive.</p>

<p>(Ok, if I&rsquo;m being honest, the process was far less linear, with lots of experimenting. I would add some branding details, tweak the typography, and repeat iteratively.)</p>

<p>I repurposed the branding from my previous layout, using the same colors for the header, links and footer. And while I made some minor tweaks to quote formatting and the comments section, the branding is largely the same.</p>

<h3>Dropping the Sidebar</h3>

<p>I decided at the very beginning of this experiment to remove the sidebar.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten used to reading on my phone and iPad, where sites are often displayed as single column. I like the experience so much, I wanted to use it as the default for the redesigned Go Make Things.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest: there&rsquo;s usually nothing all that important in the sidebar, anyways.</p>

<h3>Adding Responsive Web Design</h3>

<p>Normally, responsive design is something I build in from the very start. However, because this is a single column layout, there weren&rsquo;t many considerations in the way of reflowing a grid.</p>

<p>This is, in fact, the easiest responsive site I&rsquo;ve ever built. I made just a handful of small adjustments:</p>

<ul>
<li>I changed the main container div from <code>width: 640px;</code> to <code>max-width: 640px;</code>. This causes the site to fluidly resize itself on smaller screens. (<em>Max-width isn't supported by IE6, but the browser is now more than ten years old, and I'm not longer supporting it for this site.</em>)</li>
<li>I decreased the line height to 25 pixels for screens below 640 pixels (<em>again, using the Golden Ratio Typography calculator to determine the right line height for smaller site widths</em>).</li>
<li>I decreased the left margin on lists on quotes for improved readability on smaller screens.</li>
<li>I decreased the font size of H1 and H2 headers on smaller screens, keeping them within the typographic scale.</li>
<li>I set form inputs to span the full width of the screen on smaller devices.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that&rsquo;s pretty much it.</p>
